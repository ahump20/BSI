# Blaze Sports Intel (BSI) — core rules

## Product + stack
- Product: BlazeSportsIntel.com — real-time sports analytics + coverage (especially college baseball) with a strong story-driven brand voice.
- Deployment: Cloudflare Developer Platform (Workers, Pages, D1, KV, R2) via Wrangler.
- Code standards: production-ready only. No fake endpoints, no placeholder logic, no "TODO: implement".

## Engineering expectations
- Prefer minimal diffs over rewrites.
- Preserve existing style and structure unless there is a clear win.
- TypeScript must be strict: no `any`, no silent `catch`, no swallowed errors.
- When you change behavior, include: what changed, why, and how to verify (commands/tests).

## Output expectations
- If you're about to touch multiple files: propose a short plan first, then implement.
- When you implement: explain the diff at a high level (no novel-length commentary).
