# Games (BSI)

Interactive games in the `games/` directory (Phaser, Godot, etc.)

## Available games
| Game | Path | Engine |
|------|------|--------|
| Backyard Baseball | `games/backyard/` | TBD |
| Blitz | `games/blitz/` | TBD |
| Hoops | `games/hoops/` | TBD |
| QB Challenge | `games/qb-challenge/` | TBD |

## Conventions

### Deployment
- Each game has its own `wrangler.toml`
- Deploy independently from main site
- Use Cloudflare Pages for static game assets

### Performance
- Target 60fps on mobile
- Lazy load game assets
- Use WebGL where supported, canvas fallback

### Data integration
- Games can fetch live data from BSI APIs
- Cache aggressively for offline play
- Include loading states for data fetches

### Accessibility
- Include pause functionality
- Support keyboard controls where possible
- Provide audio alternatives for visual cues

## File structure per game
```
games/{game-name}/
├── src/           # Game source code
├── assets/        # Sprites, audio, etc.
├── wrangler.toml  # Cloudflare config
