# Zero Placeholders Policy (BSI)

## Forbidden patterns
Never write:
- `// TODO: implement`
- `// FIXME`
- `throw new Error('Not implemented')`
- `return null; // placeholder`
- `console.log('TODO')`
- Fake data that looks real but isn't
- Mock endpoints that return hardcoded responses in production

## What to do instead
- If you can't implement fully: say so, don't fake it
- If you need more info: ask for it
- If it's complex: break into smaller pieces, implement each fully
- If external API isn't available: implement proper error handling, not fake data

## Fake data vs. test fixtures
- **Forbidden:** Fake data in production code
- **Allowed:** Test fixtures clearly marked in `tests/` directory
- **Allowed:** Seed data for local development with clear documentation

## Documentation
- If referencing future work, use GitHub issues not TODO comments
- Link to the issue: `// See: https://github.com/ahump20/BSI/issues/123`

## Why this matters
BSI is a sports intelligence product. Fake data destroys credibility. Every stat, score, and fact must be real or clearly marked as unavailable.
