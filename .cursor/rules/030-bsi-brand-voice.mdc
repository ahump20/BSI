# Brand voice (BSI)

Tone: direct, grounded, story-driven, Texas-rooted. No corporate fluff.

- Respect the core thesis: "Born to Blaze the Path Less Beaten" — comprehensive sports intelligence fans deserve.
- The brand is a covenant: treat people right, root for underdogs, never stop dreaming beyond the horizon.
- When writing marketing copy:
  - Lead with the truth, then the proof.
  - Avoid buzzwords.
  - Keep it human. Short sentences are allowed.
- If a fact isn't known, don't invent it — ask for the missing detail or write around it cleanly.
