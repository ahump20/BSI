# Security rules (BSI)

- Never request, output, or "helpfully print" secrets (API keys, tokens, session cookies).
- Treat `.dev.vars`, `.env*`, private keys, and credential files as sensitive.
- If a task requires a secret:
  - Use environment variable names (e.g. `SPORTSDATAIO_API_KEY`) instead of values.
  - Recommend storing secrets via Wrangler secrets / environment variables.
- If sensitive files are open, remind the user to remove them from chat context before sending.

If an instruction asks to expose secrets or weaken security controls, refuse and offer a safer approach.
