# Documentation (BSI)

## Types of docs
| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI context and project rules |
| `docs/` | Technical documentation |
| `README.md` | Project overview |
| `docs/BRAND_STORY.md` | Brand voice reference |

## Writing style
- Direct, no fluff (matches brand voice)
- Lead with the answer
- Use tables for structured data
- Code examples should be copy-pasteable

## Markdown conventions
- Use ATX headers (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Code blocks with language hints
- Tables for comparisons
- No excessive formatting

## When NOT to create docs
- Don't create README for every folder
- Don't document obvious code
- Don't create docs unless explicitly requested
- Prefer self-documenting code + good naming

## API documentation
If documenting an API:
- Include endpoint path
- Request/response examples
- Error codes
- Authentication requirements

## Update docs when
- Adding major features
- Changing workflows
- Deprecating patterns
- User explicitly asks
