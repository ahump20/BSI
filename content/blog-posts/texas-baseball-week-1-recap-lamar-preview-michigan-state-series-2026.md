## Week 1, distilled

Texas walked out of Opening Weekend 3-0, outscoring UC Davis 27-7, and doing it with two traits that usually age well: strike-throwing starters and a lineup that refused to chase early-count outs.

If Week 1 is about establishing a baseline, this one was loud: Texas posted **25 walks vs 19 strikeouts**, hit **.330** as a team (30-for-91), and opened the year with an on-base percentage north of **.460**. The rotation set the tone, and the offense repeatedly turned “one run” innings into “four run” innings.

## The shape of the weekend

### 1) Free bases were a feature, not a fluke
Texas drew **7 walks** in the opener, then doubled down with **9 walks** on Saturday and **9 more** on Sunday. That is 25 walks in three games, and it matters because it compresses variance. You do not need three hits in an inning if you are willing to accept two walks and a sacrifice fly.

A micro example: Saturday’s game flipped when Texas loaded the bases quickly after Ethan Mendoza’s game-tying homer, then cashed with Casey Borba’s sacrifice fly and an aggressive double-steal sequence that manufactured an extra run.

### 2) The starters handed the bullpen clean innings
Across the three starts (Riojas, Harrison, Volantis), Texas got **17 1/3 innings**, **9 hits**, **4 walks**, and **23 strikeouts**. That starter WHIP (0.75) is not “small sample hype”, it is a real foundation.

Volantis’ Sunday outing was the weekend’s cleanest sentence: **7.0 IP, 1 H, 0 ER, 8 K** and he carried a no-hitter into the sixth. That performance earned him **SEC Co-Pitcher of the Week** honors.

### 3) There’s one obvious cleanup item: defense
Texas committed **four errors** across three games, including **three** in the finale. The good news is the pitching and walk volume created enough margin that it never became a story. The better news is that this is usually fixable in March, not a roster-level limitation.

## Game-by-game: what actually happened

### Game 1 (Feb. 13): Texas 12, UC Davis 2 (7 innings)
The opener looked like a normal “feel-out” game until it didn’t. Texas put up a **three-spot in the third** to grab the lead, then detonated the run rule with a **four-run fifth** and a **five-run seventh**.

**Key swings**
- **Aiden Robbins:** a go-ahead two-run homer in the third and an RBI double in the fifth.  
- **Ethan Mendoza:** the walk-off, three-run homer to end it early in the seventh.

**Key statlines (Texas)**
- **Anthony Pack Jr.:** 3-for-3, 2 RBI, plus a walk.  
- **Ruger Riojas:** 5.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 9 K (78 pitches).  
- **Max Grubbs:** finished the last two innings.

---

### Game 2 (Feb. 14): Texas 6, UC Davis 4
This one required real work. Texas trailed 2-0 through four, then scored **six unanswered** across the fifth and sixth to seize control. The middle innings were essentially “walk, double, pressure, repeat.”

**Key swing**
- **Ethan Mendoza:** a game-tying two-run homer (measured 417 feet in the UT recap) and later an RBI single. He finished **3-for-4 with 3 RBI**.

**Pitching notes**
- **Luke Harrison:** 5 1/3 IP, 2 ER, 6 K.  
- **Hudson Hamilton:** recorded the save, shutting the door in the ninth with a strikeout to end it.

---

### Game 3 (Feb. 15): Texas 9, UC Davis 1
Sunday was the “ceiling” game: Texas scored one in the second, then hung **six runs in the third**, sending **11 batters** to the plate. After that, it was Volantis’ afternoon.

**Key swing**
- **Adrian Rodriguez:** bases-clearing double in the third that broke the game open.

**Pitching notes**
- **Dylan Volantis:** 7.0 IP, 1 H, 0 ER, 8 K.  
- **Michael Winter:** two scoreless innings in his college debut to finish the sweep.

## Week 1 performers: the short list

**Ethan Mendoza**  
Weekend line: **6-for-12 (.500), 2 HR, 7 RBI, 3 BB.** He drove in runs in all three games and authored the biggest swing of two of them.

**Anthony Pack Jr.**  
Weekend line: **6-for-11 (.545), 2 BB, 5 R.** Constant traffic at the bottom of the order, and it kept turning the lineup over for the top.

**Aiden Robbins**  
Weekend line: **5-for-11 (.455), HR, 4 RBI, 2 BB, 2 SB.** Impacted the game with power and legs.

**Dylan Volantis**  
The weekend’s best pitcher. A no-hit bid into the sixth, career-long 7.0 innings, and the conference weekly hardware to match.

## Next up: Tuesday vs Lamar

**Game:** Lamar at Texas  
**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Feb. 17, 5:00 p.m. CT  
**Venue:** UFCU Disch-Falk Field

### What Lamar is bringing to Austin
Lamar opened 2026 by splitting its first series at home, going **2-1 vs Oakland** (wins of 8-2 and 9-7 before a 10-inning, 3-2 loss). The early profile is exactly what you would expect from a capable midweek opponent: they can score in chunks, and they are comfortable playing close late.

In Lamar’s season-opening win, the Cardinals did most of their damage in a single inning, with Beau Durbin’s two-run double and Tab Tracy’s two-RBI single helping turn the second inning into a separator.

### Keys for Texas
1) **Keep the walk edge.** Week 1’s plate discipline is a repeatable advantage in midweeks, where pitching plans are usually thinner.  
2) **Win the first pitch.** Lamar’s best path is early-count damage. If Texas’ staff gets strike one, it forces the game into Texas’ depth.  
3) **Play clean.** Midweeks are where extra outs become “cheap runs.” Texas can remove Lamar’s best offensive weapon by simply converting routine plays.

## Weekend 2 preview: Michigan State at Texas

**Series:** Michigan State at Texas (3 games)  
**Dates:** Feb. 20-22  
**Venue:** UFCU Disch-Falk Field

### Why this series matters
Week 1 was a controlled environment. Weekend 2 is not. Michigan State arrives with a road-tested résumé already, and this is the first series where Texas can’t count on the opponent blinking.

### What to know about Michigan State
The Spartans opened the season by taking a road series from **No. 8 Louisville**, going **2-1**. The opener was a 4-3 upset powered by two home runs and steady pitching. A day later they blew it open 13-4, fueled by **Parker Picot’s eight-RBI** day. They dropped the finale 9-1, but still left Louisville with a statement series win.

### Three series keys for Texas
1) **Start fast offensively.** Michigan State has already shown it can win on the road. Turning Disch into a factor early matters.  
2) **Protect the strike zone.** The Spartans’ power plays if you give them free baserunners. Texas’ best version is simple: strike one, expand later.  
3) **Convert leverage at-bats.** Texas created traffic all weekend. Against a better opponent, the separator is two-out execution, not total hits.

---

## Bottom line
Texas did what an elite team is supposed to do in Week 1: dominate the controllables, bank three wins, and reveal a clear identity. Now the calendar starts asking harder questions.

Tuesday’s Lamar game is about maintaining standards. Weekend 2 against Michigan State is about validating them.
