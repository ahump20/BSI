## 🧮 Simulation Methodology

### Pythagorean Win Expectation
```
Win% = (Points Scored ^ Exponent) / (Points Scored ^ Exponent + Points Allowed ^ Exponent)
```

**Sport-Specific Exponents:**
- **SEC Football**: 2.37
- **NFL**: 2.37
- **MLB**: 1.83

### Win Probability Calculation

Each game's win probability is calculated using:

1. **Base Probability**: Pythagorean expectation
2. **Opponent Adjustment**: ±30% based on opponent strength (0-1 scale)
3. **Home Field Advantage**:
   - SEC: +8% (home) / -8% (away)
   - NFL: +6% (home) / -6% (away)
   - MLB: +4% (home) / -4% (away)
4. **Recent Form Factor**: Last 5 games weighted exponentially (90%-110% multiplier)
5. **Injury Impact**: 0-1 scale (1.0 = no injuries)
6. **Strength of Schedule**: ±10% adjustment based on opponent quality

**Final Win Probability Range**: 5%-95% (no guarantees in sports)

### Simulation Process

For each team, 10,000 seasons were simulated:
1. Start with current win-loss record
2. For each remaining game:
   - Calculate win probability using factors above
   - Generate random number (0-1)
   - If random < win probability → team wins
3. Record final win total
4. Repeat 10,000 times

### Statistical Output

From 10,000 simulations per team:
- **Projected Wins**: Mean of all simulated win totals
- **Win Distribution**: Probability of finishing with each win total
- **Confidence Intervals**:
  - 5th Percentile: Bottom of expected range
  - Median (50th): Most likely outcome
  - 95th Percentile: Top of expected range
- **Playoff Probability**: % of simulations meeting playoff threshold
- **Championship Probability**: % of simulations meeting elite threshold

## 🔮 Insights & Analysis

### NFL Powerhouses
The **Kansas City Chiefs** dominate projections with a 15.6-1.4 projected record and **56.6% Super Bowl probability** – the highest in the league. Their Pythagorean expectation of 71.8% combined with strong recent form (5-0 last 5 games) drives elite projections.

### SEC Dominance
**Georgia Bulldogs** lead the SEC with a perfect 12-2 projection and **100% championship probability**. Their 445 points scored against just 215 allowed (2.07 ratio) creates the strongest Pythagorean profile in college football.

### MLB Juggernauts
The **Baltimore Orioles** (101-61 projection) edge out the **Dodgers** (98-64) for the best MLB record. Their 878 runs scored with 658 allowed creates a .606 Pythagorean win percentage, translating to near-certain playoff berth.

### Statistical Surprises
- **Minnesota Vikings** project to 14.6 wins despite being undervalued in media coverage
- **St. Louis Cardinals** struggle with just 71-91 projection (0% playoff probability)
- **Miami Dolphins** miss playoffs in simulations despite recent competitiveness
