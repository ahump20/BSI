- Sports data (scores, standings, statistics) is always current, complete, or error-free
- Predictions or analytics will be accurate or come to pass
- Third-party data sources are free from errors or omissions
- Real-time updates occur without delay

### 2.2 Third-Party Data Dependency

Our Service aggregates data from third-party sources including:
- MLB Stats API (© MLB Advanced Media, L.P.)

- Official league records may differ from aggregated databases
- Historical context and interpretations may vary

### 2.4 Data Freshness

**Real-Time Data:**

## 3. Predictive Analytics and AI Models

### 3.1 Nature of Predictions

Our predictive analytics, including:
- Season win/loss projections
- Playoff probability calculations
- Player performance forecasts
- NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) valuations

are **probabilistic estimates based on statistical models and machine learning algorithms**.

### 3.2 No Guarantees

**PREDICTIONS ARE NOT GUARANTEES.**

- Sports outcomes are inherently uncertain and affected by countless variables
- Our models cannot account for injuries, roster changes, weather, officiating, or other unpredictable factors

### 3.3 Model Limitations

**Factors our models may not fully capture:**
- Intangible elements (team chemistry, motivation, momentum)
- Coaching decisions and in-game adjustments
- Psychological factors (pressure, home-field advantage nuances)
- Unforeseen events (injuries, suspensions, trades, rule changes)
- External conditions (weather, travel, stadium conditions)

### 3.4 Confidence Levels

When we provide confidence scores or probability estimates (e.g., "75% chance of winning"):
- These represent statistical likelihood, not certainty
- A 75% prediction means 25% of the time the opposite outcome occurs
- Confidence levels are derived from historical model performance
- Actual outcomes may differ significantly from predicted probabilities

### 3.5 Continuous Improvement

Our models are continuously refined and updated. This means:
- Predictions from earlier in the season may be less accurate than later predictions

### 4.2 Valuation Methodology

**Limitations:**

- Market conditions change rapidly; valuations may become outdated
- We do not have access to actual NIL deal terms (which are often confidential)

### 4.3 No Endorsement

Publication of NIL valuations does NOT imply:
- Endorsement of the athlete or their marketability
