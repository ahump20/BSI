## Markdown to HTML Conversion

**Options for Serving Legal Documents:**

### Option 1: Direct Markdown Rendering (Recommended)
Use a markdown rendering library in your application:

**JavaScript (Client-Side):**
```javascript
// Using marked.js
import { marked } from 'marked';

fetch('/legal/privacy-policy.md')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(markdown => {
    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = marked.parse(markdown);
  });
```

**Server-Side (Cloudflare Workers):**
```javascript
import { marked } from 'marked';

export async function onRequest(context) {
  const markdownPath = context.request.url.split('/legal/')[1] + '.md';
  const markdown = await context.env.ASSETS.fetch(`/legal/${markdownPath}`).then(r => r.text());
  const html = marked.parse(markdown);

  return new Response(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head><title>Legal - ${markdownPath}</title></head>
    <body>${html}</body>
    </html>
  `, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }
  });
}
```

### Option 2: Pre-Convert to HTML
Use a build script to convert markdown to HTML:

**Using Pandoc:**
```bash
pandoc privacy-policy.md -o privacy-policy.html --standalone --css=/css/legal.css
```

**Using markdown-it (Node.js):**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const markdownIt = require('markdown-it');
const md = markdownIt();

const files = ['terms-of-service', 'privacy-policy', 'acceptable-use-policy', 'disclaimer', 'cookie-policy', 'copyright-dmca'];

files.forEach(file => {
  const markdown = fs.readFileSync(`${file}.md`, 'utf8');
  const html = md.render(markdown);
  const fullHtml = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>${file.replace(/-/g, ' ')} - Blaze Sports Intelligence</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/legal.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    ${html}
  </div>
  <footer>
    <a href="/legal">Return to Legal Hub</a> |
    <a href="/">Home</a>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
  `;
  fs.writeFileSync(`${file}.html`, fullHtml);
});
```

**Build Script (`package.json`):**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:legal": "node scripts/build-legal.js"
  }
}
```
