Setup

                Effort ≠ excellence; excellence = repeatable controllables. Today we inventory what's actually controllable.

Story: Post-Loss Recentering

                After a tough loss, Augie gathered the team. No chalk talk. He handed each player a card: "Write three things you controlled today. Pin it in your locker."

                The next day, players arrived to see their control cards taped up. Practice focused exclusively on those controllables. No mention of the loss. Just: "Can you repeat what you controlled yesterday?"

                Two days later, they won. Not because they "tried harder"—because they executed cleaner controllables.

Lens: Three Tools

### Tool A — Control Inventory

                What's truly controllable *today*? Not "work hard." That's vague. Try: "complete 15 quality swings with proper load sequence." Controllable, measurable, today.

### Tool B — Effort Taxonomy

                Effort (raw energy) vs. execution (quality). You can give max effort and still miss the cue. Excellence is repeatable execution, not just hustle.

### Tool C — Feedback Loop

                One play → one cue → one correction. Don't pile seventeen adjustments. Pick the one that unlocks the rest.

Practice: Three Drills

                **Drill 1: Control Cards** — Each player writes 3 controllables, tapes in helmet. Review pre/post week.

                **Drill 2: Green/Yellow/Red Cue System** — After each rep: green (repeat), yellow (tweak), red (replace).

                **Drill 3: Film to Field "One Cue Carryover"** — Extract single cue from film, apply next rep.
