"The game teaches the game." Augie Garrido said this hundreds of times, maybe thousands. It wasn't a throwaway line—it was the core of his pedagogy. He didn't believe in lecturing players about what to do in every scenario. He believed in creating scenarios so clear, so well-designed, that the lesson taught itself. And if a player didn't get it the first time? The game would teach it again. And again. Until they did.

Story: The Rundown That Taught Itself

Picture this: mid-April practice at Disch-Falk Field. Texas is working on rundowns—baserunner caught between second and third. The infielders are crisp, mechanical. They execute the drill flawlessly. Augie watches for two minutes, then stops them.

"Good," he says. "Now let's make it real."

He tells the runner: "Your job is to get safe. I don't care how." He tells the fielders: "Your job is to tag him out in two throws or less." Then he adds one constraint: "Runner, you can dive, stop short, fake a dive—anything. Fielders, you adjust or you fail."

The first attempt: chaos. The runner baits a throw, stops short, and the ball sails into the outfield. The fielders are frustrated. Augie doesn't lecture. He just says: "Again."

By the tenth rep, the fielders learn to hold the ball longer, to crowd the runner, to communicate with their eyes instead of their voices. The runner learns when to commit versus when to bait. No one told them these lessons—they emerged from the situation itself. That's constraint-led coaching. That's "the game teaches the game."

The Lens: Three Principles for Situation-Led Learning

**1. Design Constraints That Force Decisions**
Traditional coaching: "Here's the right way to do X." Constraint-led coaching: "Here's a situation where you have to figure out X." The difference is agency. When you tell a player what to do, they execute a script. When you force them to solve a problem, they internalize a principle.

**2. Let Failure Be Part of the Feedback Loop**
In the rundown drill, the fielders failed—repeatedly. Augie didn't step in to correct them. He let the situation correct them. The ball sailing into the outfield was the feedback. The runner getting safe was the feedback. The game was teaching. All Augie had to do was design the drill well enough that the lesson was obvious.

**3. Minimize Coach Talk, Maximize Reps**
Augie had a rule: if he was talking for more than 30 seconds, he was talking too much. He believed in high-rep, low-explanation environments. The game speaks louder than any coach ever could. Your job isn't to narrate the lesson—it's to create the conditions where the lesson happens.

The Archive & Ethical Note

These stories are drawn from interviews, game footage, and accounts from former players and staff. Augie passed in 2018, but his methods live on in every coach who designs practices that respect the intelligence of their players. We're not advocating a hands-off approach—we're advocating a hands-wise approach. Design the situation. Trust the process. Let the game teach.

Next episode: "Failure Is Information." Augie didn't fear failure—he weaponized it. We'll show you how to build a culture where mistakes accelerate learning instead of triggering shame. Until then: trust the game. It knows what it's doing.
