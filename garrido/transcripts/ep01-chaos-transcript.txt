                Every chaotic inning is instruction if you listen.

Story: High-Leverage Inning

                    Picture this: bottom of the seventh, two outs, bases loaded. Your ace has given up three straight hits. The crowd's on edge. Your shortstop's glancing at the dugout, wondering if the hook's coming.

                    This isn't about the next pitch. It's about what happens in the ten seconds before it. The catcher trots to the mound. No clipboard, no analytics printout. Just one sentence: "We know what we practiced. Next pitch, your choice."

                    That's Augie's fingerprint. In the chaos, give them agency. Not seventeen adjustments. One reminder: you've been here in practice. Trust your prep.

                    The pitcher nods. Resets his feet. Finds his breath cadence—four counts in, four counts out. Glances at the line he scratched in the dirt during warmups, his physical anchor. Then he looks in for the sign.

                    Next pitch: slider down and away. Batter swings over it. Inning over.

                    What won that at-bat wasn't velocity or movement. It was the reset between pitches. The ten-second protocol they'd drilled for weeks. Turn chaos into a cue.

Lens: Three Teachable Tools

### Tool A — Attention Switching

                    Augie believed attention is a muscle. Most teams train it accidentally. His teams trained it deliberately. Play-to-play focus isn't abstract—it's a literal mental shift, triggered by cue words.

                    Example cue: "Next pitch." Not "forget that error" or "stay locked in." Just: next pitch. It's directional. It pulls attention forward, not backward or sideways.

                    Practice this: after every rep—success or failure—players say aloud, "Next pitch." Repeat until it's automatic. When chaos hits in-game, the cue fires. Attention switches. Panic dies.

### Tool B — Ritualized Reset

                    Breath cadence: four counts in, hold four, four counts out. Pair it with a physical anchor. Scratch a line in the dirt. Tap your glove twice. Touch the bill of your cap.

                    The anchor doesn't have magical powers. It just gives the mind a handle. When chaos spirals, grab the handle. Breath + anchor = reset.

                    Augie would script these resets into practice. Every ten reps, mandatory ten-second reset. Players who skipped it? They ran. Not as punishment—as a reminder that resets aren't optional. They're the infrastructure.

### Tool C — Error-as-Data

                    Most coaches moralize errors. "That was lazy." "You're not focused." Augie treated errors like broken code: factual, not moral.

                    Within ten seconds of an error, give one factual cue. Not "you're better than that." Try: "Your front shoulder flew open. Next rep, keep it closed."

                    Error-as-data removes shame. Shame blocks learning. Data opens it. Players who hear factual corrections adjust faster, because they're not defending their ego—they're just fixing the code.

Close & Call to Action

                    **Assignment:** Run "Two-Strike Toggle" drill twice this week. Log reset count before and after. Track improvement.

                    Come back Tuesday for Episode 02: *Respect the Game, Not the Result*. We'll talk about the control inventory—what's actually controllable, and what's theater.
