<h1>Episode 04: Failure as Information</h1>
<p><strong>The Garrido Code</strong> | Practice Drills & Implementation</p>
<div class="drill-header">
<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 1: Error Response Protocol</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Immediate Correction
</div>
<p class="drill-description">After every error in practice, player must verbalize the lesson and immediately get a corrective rep. No lingering, no shame—just extract the lesson and apply it.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Set up live defensive drills (ground balls, fly balls, throws to bases).</li>
<li>When a player makes an error, stop the drill briefly. Ask: "What happened? What did you learn?"</li>
<li>Player must verbalize the issue (e.g., "I didn't get my feet set," "I took my eye off the ball," "I rushed the throw").</li>
<li>Immediately give them another rep at the same skill. No delay. No judgment. Just: "Okay, here's your chance to apply it."</li>
<li>Track whether the corrective rep is successful. If yes, celebrate the adjustment. If no, repeat the process.</li>
<li>Over time, players internalize this loop: error → analysis → correction → rep. It becomes automatic.</li>
<li>Use this in games too: if a player makes an error in the field, find a way to get them a similar play in the next inning (if possible).</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Verbal explanation quality (can they identify the root cause?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Corrective rep success rate (did they fix it?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Time between error and corrective rep (shorter is better)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Repeated errors (indicates lesson not internalized)</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 2: Failure Scoreboard</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Gamified Learning
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Track failures alongside successes. Publicly celebrate "most productive failure" of the week—the error that taught the best lesson. This normalizes failure as part of learning.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Create a physical or digital scoreboard visible to the team. Columns: "Successes" and "Productive Failures."</li>
<li>After each practice, ask players to nominate a "productive failure" from that day—a mistake they or a teammate made that led to a clear lesson.</li>
<li>The team votes on the most valuable failure of the week. Winner gets recognition (small award, shoutout, etc.).</li>
<li>Key rule: To qualify as a "productive failure," the player must articulate what they learned and how they'll adjust.</li>
<li>Post the scoreboard in the locker room. Over time, players start reframing errors: "This could be our productive failure of the week."</li>
<li>This shifts team culture: failure isn't shameful—it's data. The goal isn't to avoid errors; it's to extract maximum learning from them.</li>
<li>Use this in team meetings too: review game film and ask "What was our most productive failure this week?"</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Number of failures nominated per week (engagement indicator)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Quality of lessons articulated (depth of insight)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Team participation (are players comfortable sharing failures?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Repeated vs novel failures (are they making new mistakes or stuck in loops?)</div>
</div>

<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 3: Rapid Fire Repetition</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Volume Over Perfection
</div>
<p class="drill-description">High-rep drills where the goal is volume, not perfection. Players get so many reps they can't dwell on mistakes—they just move to the next one. This builds resilience.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Set up stations: hitting, fielding, throwing, baserunning. Each station has a specific skill focus.</li>
<li>Time limit: 90 seconds per station. Goal: as many reps as possible in that window.</li>
<li>No stopping to analyze mistakes mid-drill. If you miss a ground ball, the next one is already coming. If you swing and miss, the next pitch is already on the way.</li>
<li>After each station, players rotate. No time to dwell—just volume.</li>
<li>After the full rotation, debrief: "What patterns did you notice in your mistakes?" "What adjustments did you make on the fly?"</li>
<li>The goal: desensitize players to failure by making it so frequent and fast-paced that it loses emotional weight.</li>
<li>Over time, players develop a "next pitch" mentality: they don't ruminate on errors because the next opportunity is always seconds away.</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">

<div class="metric-item">• •Reps per 90-second window (volume indicator)</div>
