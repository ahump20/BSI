<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 1: Baserunning Decision Tree</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Constraint-Led Learning
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Forces runners to read live situations (ball in dirt, passed ball, wild pitch) and make real-time go/no-go decisions without coach instruction.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Set up live batting practice with full defense and baserunners.</li>
<li>Announce: "Every pitch, runners must decide: advance or hold." No coach signals allowed.</li>
<li>Introduce variability: pitcher throws in the dirt, catcher blocks but ball rolls 10 feet away, etc.</li>
<li>Runner must decide in real-time: go for next base or hold position.</li>
<li>After each rep, ask the runner: "Why did you go?" or "Why did you hold?" They verbalize their read.</li>
<li>Rotate runners through all bases (1st, 2nd, 3rd) so they experience different angles and distances.</li>
<li>Track: Did the runner's decision match the situation? Over time, their reads get faster and more accurate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Decision accuracy (correct read vs incorrect read)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Decision latency (how fast they commit)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Safe/out ratio when they choose to advance</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Verbal explanation quality (can they articulate what they saw?)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 2: Live Scrimmage with Zero Coach Interference</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Self-Organizing Practice
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Full 9-inning scrimmage where coaches observe but never intervene. Players must self-correct, communicate, and adjust on the fly—exactly like a real game.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Split team into two squads. Set up full 9-inning scrimmage format.</li>
<li>Announce: "Coaches will not call timeout, correct mistakes, or offer advice during play. You solve problems as they arise."</li>
<li>Players are on their own: if the defense misaligns, they fix it. If baserunning breaks down, they adjust next inning.</li>
<li>Coaches take notes on what breaks and what self-corrects. No intervention mid-game.</li>
<li>After the scrimmage: debrief as a team. Ask: "What did you notice?" "What adjustments did you make?" Let players lead the reflection.</li>
<li>Use video review to highlight moments where players self-organized effectively (or didn't).</li>
<li>Repeat weekly. Over time, players develop game-management skills that don't require coach micromanagement.</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Self-corrections made (defensive alignments, baserunning adjustments)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •In-game communication frequency (verbal cues, signals)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Repeated errors (indicates lesson not yet internalized)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Quality of post-game reflections (depth of insight)</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 3: Small-Sided Games with Variable Outs</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Decision Pressure
</div>
<p class="drill-description">3v3 or 4v4 mini-games with modified rules (2 outs instead of 3, bases 60 feet instead of 90). Creates high-rep decision-making in compressed time.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Set up two small diamonds (60-foot bases instead of 90). Use cones or bases.</li>
<li>Teams of 3-4 players each. One team hits, one team fields. Rotate every 2 outs.</li>
<li>Rule modification: only 2 outs per inning instead of 3. This increases urgency and decision density.</li>
<li>No coach calls: players decide when to bunt, when to steal, when to throw to which base.</li>
<li>Keep score. Winning team stays on offense. Creates competitive pressure.</li>
<li>After each round, rotate teams. Every player experiences offense and defense multiple times.</li>
<li>Debrief: "What situations forced the toughest decisions?" "What did you learn about reading the defense?"</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Decisions per minute (game speed indicator)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Successful offensive plays (bunts, steals, hit-and-runs)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Defensive efficiency (outs recorded / opportunities)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Communication clarity (verbal calls, hand signals)</div>
