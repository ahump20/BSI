<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 1: Metaphor of the Week</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Language as Instruction
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Each week, introduce one metaphor that reframes a skill (e.g., "Defense is a conversation," "Hitting is breathing"). Players must apply it in practice and explain how it changed their approach.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>At the start of the week, present a metaphor that relates to a skill you're working on (e.g., "Baserunning is like chess—think two moves ahead").</li>
<li>Write the metaphor on a whiteboard in the locker room. Keep it visible all week.</li>
<li>During practice, reference the metaphor when coaching that skill. Instead of technical jargon, use the metaphor as shorthand.</li>
<li>At the end of the week, ask players to reflect: "How did this metaphor change how you approached the skill?" "What did it help you see differently?"</li>
<li>Rotate metaphors weekly. Over the season, players build a library of mental models.</li>
<li>Track which metaphors resonate most. Some players are visual learners, others are kinesthetic—different metaphors will click for different people.</li>
<li>Use player-generated metaphors too. If a player comes up with a great analogy, elevate it to "Metaphor of the Week."</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Metaphor recall rate (how many players can repeat it at end of week?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Application insights (how did it change their approach?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Performance improvement (did the reframe unlock better execution?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Player-generated metaphors (are they internalizing the language?)</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="drill-header">
<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 2: Story Circle</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Narrative Learning
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Weekly team storytelling session where players share stories of adversity, success, or learning moments. Stories stick better than lectures—this builds team memory and culture.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Once a week (e.g., Monday team meeting), gather the team in a circle. No distractions—phones away, full attention.</li>
<li>One player (rotating each week) shares a story. Could be from their own career, a game they played, a challenge they overcame, or a lesson they learned.</li>
<li>The story must have a clear lesson or takeaway. No rambling—aim for 3-5 minutes max.</li>
<li>After the story, open it to the group: "What did you take from that?" "How does it apply to what we're working on this week?"</li>
<li>Coach can also share stories—from Augie's career, from other sports, from history. The goal is to build a shared narrative library.</li>
<li>Over the season, players start referencing past stories during practice: "Remember when [player] told that story about..."</li>
<li>This creates team lore. Stories become shorthand for values and lessons.</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Stories shared per season (volume of narrative culture)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Team engagement (are players listening? asking questions?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Story recall (do players reference old stories in new contexts?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Emotional resonance (did the story move the team?)</div>
</div>

<h3 class="drill-title">Drill 3: Compressed Coaching</h3>
<span class="drill-label">Economy of Language
</div>
<p class="drill-description">Challenge yourself to explain a skill in 10 words or less. Forces you to find the essential truth of the instruction—no fluff, just clarity.</p>
<ol class="steps-list">
<li>Pick a skill you're coaching this week (e.g., bunting, stealing bases, turning double plays).</li>
<li>Write down your typical coaching explanation. How many words? How long does it take?</li>
<li>Now compress it to 10 words or less. What's the absolute core of the instruction?</li>
<li>Test the compressed version with players. Did they understand? Did they execute?</li>
<li>Refine the compressed phrase based on feedback. Keep iterating until you have a clear, memorable instruction.</li>
<li>Use the compressed phrase as your primary coaching cue during practice. Save longer explanations for team meetings or video review.</li>
<li>Track: Does the compressed cue improve response time and execution clarity?</li>
</ol>
<div class="metrics">
<h4>• Key Metrics to Track</h4>
<div class="metrics">
<div class="metric-item">• •Word count (can you get it under 10 words?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Player comprehension (do they understand the compressed cue?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Execution speed (does the short cue speed up response?)</div>
<div class="metric-item">• •Memorability (do players recall the cue days/weeks later?)</div>
