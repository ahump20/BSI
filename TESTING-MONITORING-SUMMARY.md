   - Response times (P95, P99)
   - Cache hit rate (target: >80%)
   - Error rates

**Using Command Line:**

```bash
# Check deployment status
wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=blazesportsintel

# View recent logs
wrangler pages deployment tail --project-name=blazesportsintel

# Check KV cache
wrangler kv:key list --namespace-id=a53c3726fc3044be82e79d2d1e371d26
```

## 🔍 Current Status (October 2025)

### Expected Behavior

**✅ Normal:**
- Games API returns empty array (`count: 0`)
- "No games available" message on frontend
- Off-season messaging displayed
- All API endpoints respond with HTTP 200
- `success: true` in JSON response

**⚠️ Expected Warnings:**
- Box Score API may return 404/500 (no active games)
- Some endpoints return empty data arrays
- This is CORRECT during off-season (Oct-Jan)

**❌ Errors to Watch For:**
- HTTP 500 errors on Games API
- Missing CORS headers
- Response times > 3000ms
- Service worker failing to register
- Cache not working (same request twice, same time)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Issue: Tests Failing

**Check:**
1. Is Cloudflare Pages deployed?
   ```bash
   wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=blazesportsintel
   ```
2. Are APIs accessible?
   ```bash
   curl https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games
   ```
3. Check Cloudflare status page

### Issue: Slow Response Times

**Check:**
1. Is cache working?
   ```bash
   curl -I https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games
   # Look for Cache-Control header
   ```
2. Run same request twice:
   ```bash
   time curl https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games # First
   time curl https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games # Second (should be faster)
   ```
3. Check ESPN API status (upstream dependency)

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Check:**
1. Headers present?
   ```bash
   curl -I https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games
   # Should see: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   ```
2. OPTIONS request working?
   ```bash
   curl -X OPTIONS -I https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/games
   ```

### Issue: Service Worker Not Working

**Check:**
1. HTTPS enabled? (required for service workers)
2. Console errors?
3. Application → Service Workers in DevTools
4. Clear browser cache and retry
