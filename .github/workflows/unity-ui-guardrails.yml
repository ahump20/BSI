This PR modifies Unity UI files that are currently **FROZEN** for API-only development.

### Modified Files:
${process.env.MODIFIED_UI_FILES || 'See diff for details'}

### Required Actions:
1. **Add label**: \`ui-change\` and \`needs-design-review\`
2. **Get design approval** from @ahump20
3. **Create separate UI branch** for design changes
4. **Keep API changes separate** from UI modifications

### Frozen Directories:
- \`unity-app/Assets/Scripts/UI/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Scenes/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Prefabs/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Materials/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Textures/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Shaders/\`
- \`unity-app/Assets/Animations/\`

### Allowed Changes:
- \`unity-app/Assets/Scripts/Context7/\` (API layer)
- \`unity-app/Assets/Scripts/SportsAnalytics/\` (Data processing)
- Configuration and settings files

This helps maintain the separation between API development and UI design work.`
