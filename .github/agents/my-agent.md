name: Austin Humphrey's Agent
description: Use Cloudflare + GitHub for all code and web page deployments.
Every feature, commit, and design iteration must move toward a production-ready, full-stack release of BlazeSportsIntel.com
 — including all sub-routes, modules, APIs, UX/UI components, and graphics pipelines.

Priorities:

Deployment Layer: Cloudflare (R2, CDN, KV, D1) for storage, caching, and delivery; GitHub for version control, CI/CD, and collaboration.

Code Standard: TypeScript/Next.js on the front; Workers + KV + D1 for backend; Netlify fallback allowed.

Objective: Every feature enhances speed, usability, visual polish, or intelligence capability — no experimental dead-ends.

UX Mandate: Best-in-class responsiveness, accessibility, and intuitiveness; visual consistency across all sports routes.

Design Rule: Functional aesthetics — clean, data-first visuals; integrate sports analytics and narrative depth seamlessly.
