## Conflict Resolution Details

### Automatic Resolutions (5 branches)
These branches had diverged but Git was able to automatically merge them without conflicts:
- claude/add-sports-tools-showcase-011CUXFbrvFkrKfhEMzQk4jT
- claude/update-legal-pages-011CUPreh3JubX8oFSe6aJbB
- claude/verify-sports-data-accuracy-011CUPg3N2RaHk3CjZ5752NZ
- claude/analyze-blazesports-value-011CUPo4BspqrUaQJjYGqTf9
- claude/update-sports-data-011CUPWvbEfsrJiSFojaCyBy
- claude/improve-production-quality-011CUPFPtdq7SYsNKy435q8A

### Manual Resolutions (2 branches)

#### Branch: claude/ai-feedback-system-011CUPVfYQj2YYiqhVrDZfaz

**Conflict Type:** Add/Add conflicts in feedback system components

**Conflicted Files:**
1. `apps/web/app/feedback/practice/page.tsx`
   - Multiple sections conflicted (import statements, UI rendering, navigation)
   - Both versions implemented similar practice session functionality

2. `apps/web/components/feedback/FeedbackDashboard.tsx`
   - 9 conflict sections throughout the file
   - Similar implementations with minor variations in UI and state management

**Resolution Approach:**
- Strategy: Accept main version (--theirs)
- Reasoning: Main version represented the latest consolidated implementation
- Both versions were functionally equivalent, main had more recent refinements
- No loss of functionality - main version included all necessary features

**Commit:** `198a01e`

#### Branch: claude/longhorns-mcp-builder-011CUP1fZ6eDSeThjFfLiuLX

**Conflict Type:** Content conflicts in data feeds and dependency versions

**Conflicted Files:**
1. `mcp/texas-longhorns/feeds/baseball.json`
   - Conflict: `lastUpdated` timestamp difference
   - Branch: "2025-06-23T16:00:00-05:00"
   - Main: "2025-10-23T10:00:00-05:00" + `dataStatus` field

2. `mcp/texas-longhorns/feeds/basketball.json`
   - Similar timestamp conflict

3. `mcp/texas-longhorns/feeds/football.json`
   - Similar timestamp conflict

4. `package.json`
   - Branch version:
     ```json
     "open-next": "^3.1.3",
     "vite": "^7.1.10",
     "vitest": "^2.1.4"
     ```
   - Main version:
     ```json
     "vite": "^7.1.11",
     "vitest": "^4.0.1"
     ```

**Resolution Approach:**
- **Data feeds:** Accept main version (--theirs)
  - Main has most recent October 2025 data
  - Includes verification status fields
  - Ensures data accuracy and currency

- **package.json:** Manual merge
  - Preserved `open-next` from branch (needed for deployment scripts)
  - Used newer `vite` (7.1.11) from main
  - Used newer `vitest` (4.0.1) from main
  - Best of both versions: deployment tools + latest dependencies

**Commit:** `63f8480`

## Verification Steps

To verify all conflicts have been resolved:

```bash
# Check each resolved branch is up to date with main
git checkout claude/add-sports-tools-showcase-011CUXFbrvFkrKfhEMzQk4jT
git diff origin/main..HEAD  # Should show only new commits

# Verify no conflict markers remain
git grep -n "<<<<<<< HEAD" || echo "No conflicts found"
git grep -n "=======" || echo "No conflict markers"
git grep -n ">>>>>>> " || echo "No conflict markers"

# Run the resolution script again to confirm
./resolve-branch-conflicts.sh
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **All conflicts resolved** - No immediate actions required
2. üîÑ **Review and test** - Each branch should be tested before merging to main
3. üìù **Create PRs** - Open pull requests for resolved branches

### Future Prevention
1. **Regular Syncing** - Merge main into feature branches at least weekly
2. **Automated Checks** - Set up CI to detect divergence early
3. **Branch Policies** - Enforce branch naming and lifecycle policies
4. **Communication** - Coordinate on shared files (package.json, data feeds)

### Branch Maintenance
1. **Stale Branches** - Consider cleaning up old feature branches
2. **Session IDs** - Document the purpose of session ID suffixes
3. **Naming Convention** - Maintain consistent branch naming (claude/*, codex/*, copilot/*)

---

## Git Commands Used

### For Automatic Resolutions
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
git merge origin/main --no-edit
```
