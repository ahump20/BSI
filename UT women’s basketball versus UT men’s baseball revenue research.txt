A Comparative Financial Analysis: Texas Longhorns Men's Baseball and Women's Basketball
Executive Summary: A Tale of Two Trajectories
An in-depth financial analysis of the University of Texas men's baseball and women's basketball programs reveals a nuanced and compelling narrative that transcends simple profit-and-loss statements. While men's baseball has historically demonstrated greater financial stability, operating near a break-even point, the women's basketball program has emerged as a dominant media asset with a far superior growth trajectory. This is evidenced by an explosive rise in national viewership that now consistently surpasses its male counterpart. The financial comparison is therefore not a contest of profitability but a story of a mature, stable asset versus a high-growth, high-potential media property. Central to this dynamic was the groundbreaking 20-year, $300 million partnership between the University of Texas and ESPN that created the Longhorn Network. This venture was less a direct revenue calculation on any single sport and more a strategic investment in the entire University of Texas brand, providing an invaluable 13-year platform that incubated audiences and fundamentally altered the landscape of collegiate sports media.
The Financial Bedrock: The University of Texas Athletics Engine
To accurately assess the financial standing of individual sports programs at the University of Texas, one must first understand the macroeconomic context of the athletic department itself. Texas Athletics operates as a rare, self-sustaining financial behemoth within collegiate sports, a distinction that fundamentally shapes its internal economic strategies. The profitability of any single sport is secondary to its contribution to this larger, highly successful ecosystem.
A Self-Sustaining Behemoth
The financial power of Texas Athletics is staggering and has experienced remarkable growth. The department's operating budget swelled from $187 million in fiscal year (FY) 2019-20 to a record-breaking $271 million in FY 2023, the largest single-year total reported by an NCAA institution since the current reporting system began in 2005. This figure was surpassed again in FY 2024, when the department generated an unprecedented $331.9 million in revenue against $325 million in expenses, resulting in a surplus of nearly $7-8 million. This financial strength is overwhelmingly driven by the football program, which alone accounted for $183 million in revenue in FY 2023 and $204.7 million in FY 2024, creating massive operating surpluses that effectively fund the entire 21-sport department.
Generating Academic Value
Crucially, Texas Athletics is not a drain on university resources but a significant net contributor. The department receives no funding from student fees or state sources, a rarity among its peers. Instead, it consistently transfers millions of dollars back to the university's academic budget. In FY 2019-20, this transfer amounted to $10.7 million, part of an approximate $40 million contribution over the preceding four-year period. This dynamic reframes the operational "losses" incurred by most non-revenue sports; they are not financial failures but rather investments within a highly profitable portfolio. Because the department is not reliant on institutional support, it possesses the strategic freedom to invest heavily in facilities—such as the new $375 million Moody Center—and elite coaching for all its programs, even if those investments deepen short-term operating losses for a specific team. This financial insulation allows the university to build and maintain championship-caliber programs across the board, which in turn enhances the overall brand halo and feeds the football-centric revenue engine.
| Fiscal Year | Total Operating Revenue | Total Operating Expenses | Net Profit/Loss | Transfer to University Academics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2019-20 | $200.8 million | ~$178.7 million | +$22.1 million | $10.7 million |
| 2022-23 | $271 million | ~$232 million | +~$39 million | Not specified |
| 2023-24 | $331.9 million | $325 million | +$6.9 million | $2.76 million (Excess Transfer) |

A Direct Comparison: Program-Level Revenue and Profitability
A direct financial comparison between the men's baseball and women's basketball programs, based on available public data, highlights two distinctly different economic models. This disparity is rooted in the programs' respective histories; while baseball has a long-established presence, the modern women's basketball program was founded in 1974, a direct result of the legislative and cultural shifts spurred by Title IX, giving it a 50-year gap in revenue-generating maturity.
Financial Snapshots Across Fiscal Years
The most granular public data, from the 2015-16 school year, provides a clear baseline. In that year, men's baseball generated $5,529,720 in revenue against $5,627,495 in expenses, resulting in a negligible loss of $97,775. In stark contrast, women's basketball generated $2,182,054 in revenue against expenses of $5,202,774, for a substantial loss of $3,020,720. Key drivers of the women's program expenses included $1,376,764 for coaching salaries and $694,691 for athletic student aid.
More recent data from the post-2020 period shows these trends accelerating. Men's baseball revenue grew to $6,177,476, but expenses also rose to $6,701,935, widening the net loss to $524,459. During the same period, women's basketball revenue saw a modest increase to $2,543,747, but expenses ballooned to $8,105,409, pushing the net loss to $5,561,662. This level of spending places Texas among the highest-investing women's basketball programs in the nation, trailing only a handful of other elite schools.
| Program | Fiscal Year | Total Revenue | Total Expenses | Net Profit/Loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Men's Baseball | 2015-16 | $5,529,720 | $5,627,495 | -$97,775 |
| Women's Basketball | 2015-16 | $2,182,054 | $5,202,774 | -$3,020,720 |
| Men's Baseball | Post-2020 | $6,177,476 | $6,701,935 | -$524,459 |
| Women's Basketball | Post-2020 | $2,543,747 | $8,105,409 | -$5,561,662 |
Data compiled from sources.
The data clearly illustrates two divergent financial strategies. Men's baseball operates on a model approaching self-sufficiency, where revenues nearly cover all operational costs. Women's basketball, conversely, functions on a high-investment model. The dramatic increase in the program's expenses is not a sign of fiscal mismanagement but rather a leading indicator of ambition. It reflects a deliberate strategic decision to invest heavily in the pursuit of national championships. This level of spending on elite coaching, recruiting, and support is a prerequisite to achieving the on-court success that now drives the massive viewership numbers that define the program's modern value. The financial loss is the direct cost of building a premier national media asset.
The ESPN Factor: The Longhorn Network and the Monetization of a Brand
The financial narrative of Texas Athletics over the past 13 years is inextricably linked to ESPN and the creation of the Longhorn Network (LHN). Launched in 2011, this partnership was a landmark moment in college sports, fundamentally altering the media landscape and the financial power dynamics within it.
A Landmark Agreement with Strategic Intent
The agreement was a 20-year, $300 million contract that granted ESPN the rights to create a 24/7 network dedicated to Texas Longhorns sports. This provided the university with an average of $15 million in annual revenue, with ESPN paying over $10.98 million directly to Texas and an additional $4.02 million to its multimedia rights partner, IMG.
For ESPN, this was far more than a simple media rights purchase. At the time, conference realignment was rampant, and there was a strong possibility that Texas, the biggest brand in the Big 12, would move to the then-Pac-10 conference, which had a media deal with ESPN's rival, Fox Sports. The LHN deal has been characterized as a strategic "bribe" or a "sunk cost" by ESPN to ensure its cornerstone asset remained in the ESPN-friendly Big 12, thereby preserving the network's regional dominance. The value for ESPN was in retaining the Texas brand, not in the standalone profitability of LHN.
However, this strategic move had profound consequences. The $15 million annual payment for Texas's third-tier media rights created a massive revenue disparity within the Big 12, destabilizing the conference and fostering resentment among other member schools. This instability arguably set in motion the chain of events that culminated in Texas and Oklahoma leaving for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In a stroke of strategic irony, ESPN's investment to keep Texas in the Big 12 ultimately fueled the financial power that allowed Texas to leave for an even more lucrative partnership with ESPN in the SEC.
Exposure as a Revenue Proxy: The "Audience Incubator"
For sports like baseball and women's basketball, LHN's primary value was exposure. The network served as a 13-year "audience incubator," providing a level of consistent, high-quality broadcast coverage that was unprecedented for non-revenue sports. This built viewing habits and cultivated dedicated fanbases that might not have otherwise developed.
 * Men's Baseball: LHN televised "more than 30 home games" during the 2018 season alone, a volume of coverage far exceeding what a typical regional sports network would provide.
 * Women's Basketball: LHN consistently aired a significant portion of the team's schedule, including 14 games in the 2019-20 season. The network was scheduled to air a combined (men's and women's) 27 games in 2021-22 and 24 games in 2023-24.
The LHN era concluded on June 30, 2024, a direct consequence of Texas's move to the SEC, whose media rights are wholly controlled by ESPN through the SEC Network. This move transitions Texas from its unique single-school partnership into its new role as a flagship brand within the SEC's $3 billion, 10-year media rights deal with ESPN.
| Agreement Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| Contract Terms | 20-year agreement (2011-2031, ended early in 2024) |
| Total Value | $300 million |
| Average Annual Payout to UT | ~$15 million (via rights fees to UT and IMG) |
| Strategic Rationale for ESPN | Secure the Texas brand; prevent a move to a rival network's conference; maintain regional media dominance. |
| Key Programming (Baseball) | Over 30 home games televised in the 2018 season. |
| Key Programming (W. Basketball) | 14 games televised in the 2019-20 season. |
| Legacy/Outcome | Provided unprecedented exposure for non-revenue sports; created revenue disparity that destabilized the Big 12; ultimately paved the way for Texas's move to the SEC. |

The New Currency: Viewership, Audience Growth, and Future Media Value
While historical financial reports favor men's baseball, the forward-looking metrics of media value—specifically, television viewership—tell a different story. In the modern era of collegiate athletics, where media rights deals are the primary economic driver, the ability to command a large and engaged audience is the most valuable currency. In this arena, Texas women's basketball has become a national powerhouse, demonstrating that a program's media value can completely decouple from its on-campus profitability.
A Stark Viewership Contrast
The audience data presents a clear and dramatic contrast between the two programs.
 * College Baseball: National viewership for the NCAA baseball tournament regionals averages a respectable 264,000 viewers across ESPN's networks. A highly anticipated matchup can reach a peak audience, such as the 736,000 viewers for a Tennessee-Clemson game.
 * Texas Women's Basketball: The program regularly commands a national audience an order of magnitude larger. During the 2024-25 regular season, a game against LSU broadcast on ABC drew 1.7 million viewers, while a matchup with South Carolina on ESPN attracted 1 million viewers. These regular-season figures for a single team's game significantly exceed the viewership for the most-watched games of the entire national baseball tournament.
This trend is part of a seismic shift in the sports media market. The 2024 NCAA Women's Basketball Championship game drew a record-shattering 18.9 million viewers, making it the most-watched basketball game at any level—college or pro, men's or women's—since 2019. This explosive growth is not an anomaly but a powerful trend, also reflected in the record-breaking viewership for the Texas softball team's appearance in the Women's College World Series.
| Event Type | Event Details | Broadcast Network | Average Viewership |
|---|---|---|---|
| College Baseball | NCAA Tournament Regionals (Average) | ESPN Networks | 264,000 |
| College Baseball | NCAA Tournament Regionals (Top Game) | ESPN2 | 736,000 |
| Texas Women's Basketball | Regular Season vs. South Carolina | ESPN | 1,000,000 |
| Texas Women's Basketball | Regular Season vs. LSU | ABC | 1,700,000 |
| Texas Football | Regular Season vs. Texas A&M | ESPN | 9,500,000 |

This massive audience directly translates into future revenue. The NCAA is now implementing "performance units" for the women's tournament, for the first time tying financial distributions to on-court success and the games played in March Madness. Furthermore, the landmark House v. NCAA settlement ushers in an era of direct revenue sharing, where schools can distribute up to an initial cap of $20.5 million annually to athletes. In this new landscape, a sport's demonstrated ability to generate media revenue will be more critical than ever in determining its value and its athletes' compensation.
Strategic Synthesis and Outlook
The financial comparison of University of Texas men's baseball and women's basketball reveals two programs on divergent but equally important paths. Men's baseball represents a stable, foundational sport with a dedicated fanbase, operating on a traditional model that nears financial self-sufficiency. Women's basketball, meanwhile, represents the future of collegiate sports media: a high-investment, high-growth asset whose value is measured not on a university balance sheet but by the millions of viewers it delivers to national broadcast partners.
The 13-year tenure of the Longhorn Network was a transformative period. It provided the financial muscle and media platform that amplified the Texas brand and incubated the audiences for sports beyond football. Now, as Texas enters the SEC, it does so with a women's basketball program that is already a premier, top-tier viewership draw. This immediately positions the program as a major ratings driver for the SEC Network and its parent platforms, ESPN and ABC, significantly enhancing its value to both the conference and the network.
Looking ahead, the confluence of explosive viewership growth, the lucrative new SEC media deal, and the dawn of athlete revenue sharing will force a strategic re-evaluation of resource allocation within Texas Athletics. While football will remain the undisputed economic engine, women's basketball has proven its ability to generate immense value in the currency that matters most to media partners. This justifies the high level of investment in the program and will likely lead to its athletes receiving a significant portion of future revenue-sharing pools.
The most astute path forward for Texas Athletics is a portfolio approach: valuing men's baseball for its stability, tradition, and passionate base, while capitalizing on the meteoric, high-growth trajectory of women's basketball as a key pillar of the university's national media brand for the 21st century.
