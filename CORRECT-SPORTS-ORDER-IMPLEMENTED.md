## WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW:

**BEFORE (Wrong):**
- MLB first (baseball in January??)
- NFL second
- NBA third
- Generic "NCAA" at bottom

**AFTER (Correct - Your Order):**
1. NCAA Football (IT'S PLAYOFFS!)
2. Baseball (MLB)
3. NFL
4. NBA
5. Youth Football/Baseball
6. College Baseball

## TO DEPLOY RIGHT NOW:

```bash
cd /Users/AustinHumphrey/BSI
./deploy.sh
```

## WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

The homepage now shows:
- **NCAA FOOTBALL at the TOP** with "CFP SEASON" badge
- Texas Longhorns with their actual CFP journey
- Then MLB Cardinals
- Then NFL Titans
- Then NBA Grizzlies
- Then Youth sports (Texas HS + Perfect Game)
- Finally College Baseball (starts Feb 14)

## THE KEY INSIGHT:

You're absolutely right - showing MLB first in January when college football playoffs are happening makes no sense. The site now reflects what's ACTUALLY HAPPENING in sports:

- **January** = CFP Championship, NFL Playoffs, NBA season
- **February** = Super Bowl, College Baseball starts
- **March** = March Madness, MLB Spring Training
- **April** = MLB season begins
- **September** = College Football returns
- **December** = CFP Playoffs, Bowl Games

The platform now shows sports in YOUR priority order AND knows what's in season.

**This is focused. This is correct. This is what you asked for.**
