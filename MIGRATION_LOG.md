### Current Platform Assessment

#### Active Routes (To Be Mapped)
- Home: `/index.html`
- Sport Landing Pages: `/mlb/`, `/nfl/`, `/cfb/`, `/cbb/`
- Analytics: `/analytics.html`
- AI Copilot: `/copilot.html`
- Legal: `/legal/*`, `/privacy.html`, `/terms.html`
- Static: `/about.html`, `/contact.html`, `/methodology/`

#### API Endpoints (Cloudflare Functions)
- `/api/mlb/*` - MLB data endpoints
- `/api/nfl/*` - NFL data endpoints
- `/api/nba/*` - NBA data endpoints
- `/api/ncaa/*` - NCAA Football endpoints
- `/api/cbb/*` - NCAA Basketball endpoints
- `/api/college-baseball/*` - College Baseball (partial)

- `/api/health` - Health check
- `/api/metrics` - Analytics metrics

#### Infrastructure Components
- **Database**: D1 (`cbafed34-782f-4bf1-a14b-4ea49661e52b`)
- **Cache**: KV namespace (`a53c3726fc3044be82e79d2d1e371d26`)
- **Storage**: R2 bucket (`bsi-embeddings`)
- **AI**: Vectorize index (`sports-scouting-index`)
- **Monitoring**: Analytics Engine (`bsi_analytics`)

### Migration Decisions

#### KEEP (Port to New Platform)
- [ ] Clean UI components (auth wrappers, charts)
- [ ] Design tokens system (`tokens/tokens.json`)
- [ ] Legal pages (privacy, terms, accessibility)
- [ ] API utilities (`_utils.js`, `_middleware.js`)
- [ ] D1 schema patterns
- [ ] Analytics Engine monitoring setup

#### REFACTOR (Modernize)
- [ ] Sport landing pages → Next.js App Router
- [ ] API functions → Next.js API routes
- [ ] Static HTML → React components
- [ ] Python scripts → TypeScript/Node

#### DELETE (Off-Vision)
- [ ] Multi-sport scoreboard (keep baseball only)
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulations (non-baseball)
- [ ] Youth sports endpoints
- [ ] 3D visualizations (excessive)
- [ ] Championship intelligence platform

## Phase 2: Information Architecture & Redirects

### New Route Structure (Diamond Insights)

```
blazesportsintel.com/
├── /                              → Home (D1 Baseball scoreboard)
├── /baseball/ncaab                → D1 Baseball Hub
├── /baseball/ncaab/game/[id]     → Game Center (live tracking)
├── /baseball/ncaab/team/[slug]   → Team Hub
├── /baseball/ncaab/player/[id]   → Player Profile
├── /baseball/ncaab/standings     → Conference Standings
├── /baseball/ncaab/rankings      → Polls & RPI
├── /news                          → Auto previews/recaps
├── /about                         → Mission & Team
├── /legal/*                       → Legal pages (preserved)
└── /api/v1/*                      → Unified API
```

### Redirect Map (CSV)

**Format**: `legacy_path,new_path,status_code,reason`

```csv
/mlb/index.html,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/mlb,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/nfl/index.html,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/nfl,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/cfb/index.html,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/cfb,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/cbb/index.html,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/cbb,/,301,Focus shifted to college baseball
/analytics.html,/baseball/ncaab,301,Analytics integrated into team pages
/copilot.html,/,301,AI features retired
/api/mlb/*,/api/v1/baseball/ncaab/*,301,API restructure
/api/nfl/*,/,410,Sport no longer covered
/api/nba/*,/,410,Sport no longer covered
/api/ncaa/*,/api/v1/baseball/ncaab/*,301,API restructure
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Next.js Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
   - Read redirect map from static config
   - Apply 301/410 responses
   - Log redirect hits to Analytics Engine

2. **Validation Scripts**:
   - `scripts/check-301-consistency.sh` - Verify all redirects work
   - `scripts/check-404s.sh` - Ensure no broken links

---

## Phase 3: Technical Implementation

### Prisma Schema (PostgreSQL)

Location: `/prisma/schema.prisma`

```prisma
// Core Models
model Conference
model Team
model Player
model Game
model Event (pitch-by-pitch)
model BoxLine (player game stats)
model TeamStats
model PlayerStats
model Ranking
model Article (NLG content)

// Enums
enum GameStatus { SCHEDULED | LIVE | FINAL | POSTPONED }
enum FeedPrecision { EVENT | PITCH }
```

### API Layer (/api/v1)

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/games` - List games (filter: date, status, conference)
- `GET /api/v1/games/[id]` - Full game detail + events + box
- `GET /api/v1/teams` - List teams
- `GET /api/v1/teams/[slug]` - Team detail + roster + stats
- `GET /api/v1/players/[id]` - Player profile + game logs
- `GET /api/v1/conferences/[slug]/standings` - Conference standings
- `GET /api/v1/rankings` - Polls + RPI + strength metrics
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` - Payment processing

### Ingest Worker (Cloudflare)

**Schedule**:
- Live games: `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
- Hourly: Team stats refresh
- Nightly: Historical aggregations

**Provider Failover**:
1. Primary: SportsDataIO
2. Backup: NCAA API
3. Tertiary: ESPN

**Caching Strategy**:
- Live games: 60s KV TTL
- Standings: 4hr KV TTL
- Historical: R2 archival (immutable)

### NLG Content Generation

**Auto-Recap** (15min post-game):
- Fact-check all claims against structured data
- Generate with Anthropic Claude or OpenAI
- Store in `Article` table with `type: 'recap'`

**Auto-Preview** (6hr pre-game):
- Analyze team trends, matchup history
- Update 1hr before if lineups change
- Store with `type: 'preview'`

  - Regex-based claim extraction (scores, records, players, statistical lines)
  - `verifyScore()` - Checks game scores against database (both home/away orders)
  - `verifyRecord()` - Validates team records from season stats
  - `verifyPlayerMention()` - Verifies players against box scores and rosters
  - Confidence scoring: 1.0 (exact match), 0.9 (top performers), 0.8 (roster match)

  1. Fetch game context from database (Prisma nested includes)
  2. Initialize multi-provider LLM
  3. Fill prompt template (recap vs preview)
  4. Generate with LLM (exponential backoff retry)
  5. Parse title and content
  6. Fact-check with database verification
  7. Calculate verification score
  8. Generate summary (first 2 sentences)
  9. Calculate word count + reading time (200 WPM)

## Phase 3: Frontend MVP Progress Log

**2025-10-18 – Scoreboard modernization**

- Archived the legacy Vite scoreboard entry (`src/App.jsx`) into `archive/2025-10-13/code/legacy-components/vite/App.jsx` to keep routing focused on the Next.js App Router.
- Implemented a shared NCAA baseball scoreboard helper (`apps/web/lib/baseball/scoreboard.ts`) for server components and API routes.
- Wired `/baseball/ncaab/games` to the new helper with live regression analytics and Playwright smoke coverage.
