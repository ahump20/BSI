 * ```ts
 * const lei = new LeverageEquivalencyIndex();
 * const result = lei.compute({

 *   playoff_round: "championship",
 *   pre_play_win_prob: 0.078,

 *   outs_remaining: 1,
 *   strikes_remaining: 0,
 *   score_differential: -2
 * });
 * console.log(result.lei); // ~95 (David Freese 2011 WS triple)
