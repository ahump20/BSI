# Clutch Performance + Wearables Integration

**Feature Branch**: `claude/clutch-performance-wearables-integration-011CUhMgaMEKxXytHq5ePH5G`
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Review
**Confidence**: 88%

---

## Overview

This feature integrates athlete wearables data (WHOOP v2 API) with NBA clutch performance analytics to help coaches and analysts understand how biometric factors correlate with late-game performance.

**Key Insight**: Does an athlete's morning HRV, recovery score, or sleep quality predict their clutch performance that night?

---

## What's New

### 🗄️ Database Schema
- **6 new tables**: `wearables_devices`, `wearables_readings`, `wearables_daily_summary`, `clutch_situations`, `clutch_player_actions`, `clutch_performance_scores`
- **2 new views**: `clutch_leaderboard`, `player_wearables_summary`
- **Comprehensive indexes** for optimal query performance
- **Privacy-first design**: Consent management, data retention policies, encrypted OAuth tokens

### 📊 Data Integration
- **WHOOP v2 API Adapter** (`lib/adapters/whoop-v2-adapter.ts`)
  - OAuth 2.0 consent flow
  - Real-time webhook support
  - Fetches HRV, recovery score, sleep performance, strain
  - Rate limiting (100 req/min) + retry logic

- **NBA Stats Clutch Adapter** (`lib/adapters/nba-stats-clutch-adapter.ts`)
  - Play-by-play ingestion
  - Clutch detection (last 5:00, margin ≤5)
  - Player action extraction (shots, assists, turnovers)
  - Expected points calculation

### ⏱️ Time Alignment Service (`lib/utils/time-alignment.ts`)
- **Pre-game baseline extraction**: Morning wearables data (6am-12pm)
- **Event-to-wearable synchronization**: Match game events to closest biometric reading
- **Timezone normalization**: UTC conversion for distributed teams
- **Quality scoring**: 0.0-1.0 confidence based on time delta + data completeness

### 📈 Analytics
- **Clutch Score** (0-100): Composite metric combining success rate, points over expected, and volume
- **Wearables Correlation**: HRV deviation, recovery score, sleep performance
- **Hierarchical Bayesian Model** (future): Player-specific random effects + biometric covariates

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
psql -U your_user -d blaze_sports_intel -f api/database/migrations/2025-11-01-clutch-wearables-schema.sql
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# .env
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/whoop/callback
WHOOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install luxon zod
# or
pnpm add luxon zod
```

### 4. Test WHOOP Integration

```typescript
import { createWHOOPAdapter } from './lib/adapters/whoop-v2-adapter';

const adapter = createWHOOPAdapter();
const authUrl = adapter.getAuthorizationUrl('player-123');
console.log('Athlete consent URL:', authUrl);
```

### 5. Test NBA Clutch Detection

```typescript
import { createNBAStatsClutchAdapter } from './lib/adapters/nba-stats-clutch-adapter';

const adapter = createNBAStatsClutchAdapter();
const playByPlay = await adapter.getPlayByPlay('0022400123');
const clutchSituations = adapter.identifyClutchSituations(playByPlay, '0022400123');
console.log('Clutch windows found:', clutchSituations.length);
```

## Privacy & Consent

**CRITICAL**: This feature handles sensitive athlete biometric data. Follow these requirements:

1. **Explicit Consent Required**: Athletes must authorize WHOOP access via OAuth before data collection
2. **Data Retention**: Default 365 days, configurable per athlete
3. **Revocation**: Athletes can revoke consent anytime → all data deleted
4. **Encryption**: OAuth tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256)
5. **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA compliant (right to access, delete, portability)

---

## Testing Checklist

Before merging:

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] WHOOP OAuth flow completes (test with dev account)
- [ ] NBA clutch detection identifies situations correctly
- [ ] Time alignment matches wearables to events (±30 min accuracy)
- [ ] Privacy: Consent revocation deletes athlete data
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by team

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database**:
   - Indexes on `(player_id, reading_timestamp)`, `(game_id, situation_id)`
   - Partitioning for `wearables_readings` (optional, for high-volume data)
   - JSONB GIN indexes for raw payload queries

2. **API Rate Limits**:
   - WHOOP: 100 requests/minute (enforced by adapter)
   - NBA Stats: ~20 requests/minute (exponential backoff)

3. **Time Alignment**:
   - Window-based queries (avoid full table scans)
   - Pre-computed daily summaries for faster aggregation
   - Quality threshold filtering (exclude low-quality readings)

---

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Beta Cohort (Weeks 1-2)
- Recruit 5-10 athletes from NCAA basketball program
- Onboard athletes (consent flow)
- Validate data sync (WHOOP + NBA)

### Phase 2: Model Training (Weeks 3-6)
- Collect 1-2 months of data
- Train hierarchical Bayesian model
- Validate predictions (RMSE < 8 points)

### Phase 3: Dashboard Launch (Weeks 7-8)
- Build React dashboard with 3D visualizations
- Coach training sessions
- Gather feedback

### Phase 4: Expand to Baseball (Weeks 9-12)
- Adapt clutch detection for baseball (late innings, high-leverage)
- Integrate Baseball Savant/Statcast
- Launch for college baseball programs
