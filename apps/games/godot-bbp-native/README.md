# Backyard Blaze Ball Native (Godot 4)

This stub tracks the future native build for iOS, Android, and desktop storefronts.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download) or newer.
2. Open this folder in Godot; the editor will pick up `project.godot` automatically.
3. Press **Play** to launch the placeholder menu and inning scene.

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder scenes with production art and gameplay that mirrors the Phaser MVP.
- Wire mobile input actions to match the SwingTap mapping defined in `project.godot`.
- Integrate analytics by mirroring the lightweight postMessage schema used on the web.
- Follow the licensing and legal workflow in `LEGAL_COMPLIANCE.md` and `assets/LICENSES.md` before importing new assets.
