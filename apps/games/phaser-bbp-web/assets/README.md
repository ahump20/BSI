# Backyard Blaze Ball Placeholder Assets

This folder intentionally ships with zero binary assets. The Phaser build generates geometric sprites at runtime so the MVP can deploy without an asset pipeline. Designers can drop new sprites or audio clips here and update `BootScene` loaders. Keep replacements original and properly licensed per `assets/LICENSES.md` at the repo root.
