# BSI Content Guidelines

> **Coverage that matches your commitment.**

*Last Updated: January 2026*

## The Core Message

BSI exists for fans who care more than the average viewer. Our messaging centers on **proportional care**—the idea that your dedication deserves coverage that matches it. This isn't about attacking other outlets. It's about being genuinely useful to people who are genuinely invested.

### The Covenant, Not the Competition

We don't position BSI against competitors. We position it alongside the fans we serve. The relationship is a **covenant**: you care deeply, so we show up with coverage that respects that.

**DO:**
- "Coverage that matches your commitment"
- "For fans who know their stuff"
- "The coverage this sport deserves"
- "Finally. Depth that respects your knowledge."

**DON'T:**
- "What ESPN won't give you"
- "The coverage ESPN should have built"
- "Unlike the mainstream media..."
- "Networks ignore this sport because..."

## Voice Principles

### 1. Lead with the Answer

Don't wind up. Say what matters, then provide context.

**DO:** "Texas leads the Big 12 in run differential. Here's why that matters heading into the Texas State series."

**DON'T:** "In a season full of surprises, the Texas Longhorns have emerged as a dominant force, and when you look at the numbers..."

### 2. Be Direct, Be Warm

Texas directness with genuine warmth. No corporate speak, no false enthusiasm.

**DO:** "The bullpen's been shaky. Three blown saves in seven games. That's fixable—here's what they're working on."

**DON'T:** "The bullpen has experienced some challenges recently, but the coaching staff remains optimistic about future opportunities..."

### 3. Respect the Reader's Knowledge

Our readers aren't casual. They know what WHIP is. They understand WAR. Write for the informed fan, not the tourist.

**DO:** "His xBA sits at .280 despite the .220 average—regression's coming, and probably soon."

**DON'T:** "His expected batting average (a stat that measures how often a player should get hits based on how hard they hit the ball) suggests improvement ahead."

### 4. Show Don't Hype

Let the story speak. If it's exciting, describe what happened. Don't tell people to be excited.

**DO:** "Walk-off grand slam in the ninth. Four runs down, two outs, full count."

**DON'T:** "In an INCREDIBLE game that had EVERYTHING, the UNBELIEVABLE happened!!"

## What We Never Do

1. **Attack competitors by name**
   - No "ESPN ignores..." or "Unlike the big networks..."
   - Position around what we ARE, not what others AREN'T

2. **Overpromise or hype**
   - No "BREAKING" unless it's genuinely breaking
   - No superlatives without evidence

3. **Talk down to readers**
   - No explaining basic concepts to informed fans
   - No condescension masked as accessibility

4. **Hedge without substance**
   - No "arguably" unless actually arguing
   - No "look for them to..." without reasoning

5. **Use passive voice for decisions**
   - "Mistakes were made" → "He missed the cutoff man"
   - Give agency to actors in the story

6. **Promise things we can't verify**
   - Flag uncertainty explicitly
   - Cite sources with timestamps
   - "Per [Source]" not "reportedly"

## The North Star

Every piece of content should pass this test:

> **Does this respect the reader's time, intelligence, and investment in the sport?**

If it doesn't add value for someone who already cares deeply, it doesn't belong on BSI.
