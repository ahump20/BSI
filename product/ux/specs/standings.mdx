## Purpose
- Present up-to-date conference standings with clear sorting and filtering controls.
- Allow quick comparison between overall, conference, and home/away records.
- Support historical lookback for postseason context.

## Primary Components
- **Conference Selector:** Dropdown or segmented control for SEC, ACC, etc.
- **Standings Table:** Columns for overall, conference, home, away, streak, last 10.
- **Trend Indicators:** Arrows showing movement compared to previous day.
- **Postseason Outlook:** Bubble meter showing projected Regional seed (Diamond Pro).
- **Context Modules:** Notes for tiebreakers, clinched berths, weather delays.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Default to conference-specific view with sticky selector at top of viewport.
- Table should support horizontal scrolling with locked first column on small screens.
- Provide colorblind-safe indicators for trends (use icons + text, not color only).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conference selector defaults to user’s favorite conference (if set) else SEC.
2. Standings table sorts by conference win % descending and recalculates when filters change.
3. Trend indicators include accessible text (e.g., “Up 2 spots”).
4. Postseason outlook hides for free users, replaced with upsell CTA.
5. Data freshness timestamp displayed within 1 minute of last update.
