## Purpose
- Deliver a live, data-rich game hub with intuitive navigation between box score, plays, and team stats.
- Support real-time ingestion with Cloudflare Worker updates cached in Redis (≤60 second TTL).
- Provide premium-only layers (spray charts, pitch sequencing) without degrading free access.

## Primary Components
- **Game Header:** Teams, scoreline, inning/status pill, location, broadcast info.
- **Tabbed Navigator:** Box Score, Plays, Team Stats, with sticky tabs for mobile.
- **Live Win Probability Chart:** Sparkline with tooltips, dark-mode friendly gradient.
- **Play-by-Play Feed:** Virtualized list with play type icons and quick filters (All/Scoring/Defensive).
- **Player Spotlight Drawer:** Slide-up module showing trending players with share action.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- On mobile, header condenses into a compact card once user scrolls 120 px.
- Use CSS variables for team colors but fall back to brand palette when contrast fails.
- Tab change should maintain scroll position for each tab via stateful container.
- Provide offline placeholder state that caches last known data for 5 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Header surfaces latest score with auto-refresh and manual refresh CTA.
2. Tab switch persists selection via URL hash (`#box`, `#plays`, `#team-stats`).
3. Play-by-play feed supports virtualization (render window ≤ 30 items).
4. Win probability chart gracefully handles missing data (display message + hide chart).
5. Diamond Pro data is gated; unauthorized requests trigger `403` and fallback copy.
