## Purpose
- Aggregate national polls, RPI, and BlazeSportsIntel power metrics in one interface.
- Highlight movement week-over-week and provide context for postseason projections.
- Offer Diamond Pro features like strength-of-schedule sliders and forecast scenarios.

## Primary Components
- **Poll Selector:** Tabs for Coaches, Media, RPI, BSI Power Index.
- **Movement Indicators:** Up/down arrows with numeric delta and highlight color.
- **Strength-of-Schedule Widget:** Slider toggles to simulate future outcomes (Pro only).
- **Upcoming Spotlight:** Shows key series impacting rankings.
- **Historical View:** Accordion for prior weeks to support archival research.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Default tab shows BSI Power Index with full analytics; others show condensed tables.
- Provide inline explanations for proprietary metrics with tooltip modals.
- Keep tables accessible via sticky headers and zebra striping.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Poll selector switches tabs without full page reload; state persists in query param (`?poll=coaches`).
2. Movement indicators show `—` for no change, with accessible sr-only text.
3. Strength-of-schedule widget disabled for free users with upsell banner.
4. Upcoming spotlight cards link to relevant team or game pages.
5. Historical view caches prior week results for offline reference.

## Analytics Events
- `rankings.poll_changed`
- `rankings.future_scenario_saved`
- `rankings.spotlight_opened`
- `paywall.pro_prompt_impression`

## Open Questions
- Need data contract confirmation for RPI timing (daily vs. hourly updates).
- Determine if push notifications should trigger off ranking movement thresholds.
