## Purpose
- Showcase individual player performance, trends, and scouting intel in a mobile-first format.
- Provide clear differentiation between free stats and Diamond Pro advanced analytics.
- Support quick navigation between roster context and standalone player search results.

## Primary Components
- **Player Header:** Headshot, basic bio, handedness, eligibility, NIL prompt (if available).
- **Season Snapshot:** Slash line, OPS+, WAR, recent trend indicator.
- **Advanced Metrics Tabs:** Hitting, Pitching, Fielding sections with chart toggles.
- **Spray Chart / Pitch Mix:** Rendered via canvas with dark-mode safe palette.
- **Recruiting & Draft Notes:** Text modules with manual overrides for editorial insights.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Sticky segmented control switches between Overview, Advanced, and Notes without reflow.
- Ensure data tables scroll horizontally inside safe container on smaller screens.
- Provide Pro lock overlays with contextual copy and CTA to subscribe via Stripe checkout.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Player header loads base information with fallback silhouette for missing headshots.
2. Season snapshot displays last five games mini-trend with accessible color coding.
3. Advanced metrics tab hides locked sections until authentication confirms Pro entitlement.
4. Spray chart supports pinch-to-zoom and resets via “Reset View” button.
5. Notes module supports markdown rendering with sanitized HTML to prevent XSS.
