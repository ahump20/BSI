## Purpose
- Deliver a comprehensive, year-round team profile that blends current season metrics with historical context.
- Serve as the anchor for recruiting, roster, and schedule data while providing Diamond Pro upsells.
- Maintain modular sections so other sports can reuse the layout with minimal overrides.

## Primary Components
- **Team Overview Card:** Record, conference, rankings delta, next opponent.
- **Trend Modules:** Rolling OPS, ERA, defensive efficiency charts with tooltips.
- **Roster Table:** Sortable by position/class; integrates player headshots and quick links.
- **Schedule Grid:** Upcoming vs. completed games with result tags and streaming info.
- **Insights Rail:** Alerts for injuries, transfer portal updates, MLB draft projections.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Responsive stacked cards; charts collapse into sparkline rows below 360 px width.
- Use sticky secondary nav (Overview, Roster, Schedule, Insights) once user scrolls.
- Provide shareable metadata (OpenGraph/Twitter) featuring team colors while preserving contrast.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Overview card displays latest record, ranking changes, and next game pulled from schedule API.
2. Trend modules can toggle between 7/14/30-day windows without reloading the page.
3. Roster table supports column sorting and filters by position/class.
4. Schedule grid groups games by month; completed games show final score with link to Game Center.
5. Insights rail hides gracefully when no alerts exist, showing `No current updates` copy.

## Analytics Events
- `team.tab_changed`
- `team.roster_filter`
- `team.schedule_game_opened`
- `team.insight_alert_viewed`

## Open Questions
- Determine cadence for syncing transfer portal alerts (real-time vs. hourly batch).
- Confirm whether Diamond Pro overlays should highlight premium sections within the roster.
