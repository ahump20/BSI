phase: Phase 2 – MVP
status: Draft

## Purpose
- Provide real-time coverage of all Division I games with mobile-friendly filters.
- Highlight live matchups and quickly route users to the Game Center.
- Maintain performance under heavy traffic spikes (p99 < 200 ms API latency).

## Primary Components
- **Date Selector:** Horizontal calendar strip with Today badge and swipe gesture support.
- **Conference & Ranking Filters:** Chips with multi-select, persistent per session via local storage.
- **Game Card:** Displays teams, rankings, records, inning status, win probability sparkline.
- **Live Status Banner:** Sticky bar with count of active games and “View Live Games” anchor.
- **Empty State:** Messaging for off days with CTA to news and historical content.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Single-column stack on mobile with 12 px gutters; on tablet, switches to two-column masonry.
- Use Tailwind transitions for filter chips; ensure focus outlines meet WCAG AA.
- Live games update via polling + SSE fallback (Upstash Redis caching to prevent thrash).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Filters persist across navigation for 24 hours or until manually reset.
2. Game cards display logos, rank badges, and scoreboard text with accessible contrast ratios.
3. Live Status Banner collapses when no in-progress games exist.
4. Tap on a game card routes to `/baseball/ncaab/games/[gameId]` with the correct ID.
5. API failures show a retry CTA and log `scoreboard.load_failed` with error context (no PII).

## Analytics Events
- `scoreboard.filter_applied`
- `scoreboard.game_card_opened`
- `scoreboard.refresh_triggered`
- `scoreboard.live_banner_click`

## Open Questions
- Evaluate lazy-loading older final scores for performance vs. completeness.
- Determine if we need a “Favorites” tab before launch or post-MVP.
