## Purpose
- Establish the default landing surface for Division I baseball fans with live context and quick actions.
- Reinforce the BlazeSportsIntel brand with dark-mode visuals, Inter UI typography, and gold accent highlights.
- Surface Diamond Pro upsells without blocking free features.

## Primary Components
- **Hero Marquee:** Top 25 spotlight with live score pill, featured story, and CTA to Scoreboard.
- **Live Capsule Rail:** Horizontally scrollable cards showing in-progress games, start times, and probability trend.
- **Insights Stack:** Cards for standings snapshot, latest rankings movement, and premium projections.
- **News Carousel:** Source Serif Pro for headlines, fallback image treatment for audio-only stories.
- **Bottom Navigation:** Scores, Teams, Standings, News, Account icons with label text under 12 characters.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Mobile-first grid using Tailwind responsive utilities; default background `#1A202C` with elevated cards `#2D3748`.
- Safe area padding for iOS/Android notches; sticky bottom nav with 56 px height.
- Hero card should degrade gracefully with placeholder art if no featured image is available.
- Live Capsule cards use swipe gestures and allow long-press to follow a team (Pro prompt if not subscribed).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero Marquee renders with at least one Top 25 matchup and dynamic CTA text.
2. Live Capsule data auto-refreshes every 60 seconds with smooth shimmer loading state.
3. Insights Stack shows standings and rankings modules; errors fall back to explanatory empty states.
4. Premium upsell chip appears only for unsigned users or free plans; Pro users see quick links.
5. Navigation items remain accessible with WCAG 2.2 AA contrast.

## Analytics Events

## Open Questions
- Should portal news appear above analytics during off-season campaigns?
- Evaluate if hero should support video backgrounds without hurting performance metrics.
