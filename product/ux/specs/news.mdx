phase: Phase 2 – MVP
status: Draft

## Purpose
- Centralize editorial coverage, portal updates, and automated recaps.
- Blend LLM-assisted summaries with verified data-driven storytelling.
- Provide clear entry to Diamond Pro exclusive articles without frustrating free readers.

## Primary Components
- **Top Story Carousel:** Hero treatment with Source Serif Pro typography and gradient overlay.
- **Latest Feed:** Infinite scroll list of articles with tags (Recap, Portal, Analysis, Pro).
- **Portal Tracker:** Sticky card summarizing key transfer movement.
- **Diamond Pro Section:** Highlighted block with premium content, locked teasers, and CTA.
- **Newsletter Capture:** Dark-mode friendly form with success toast.

## Layout & Interaction Notes
- Carousel auto-advances every 8 seconds with pause-on-hover and accessible controls.
- Feed cards include estimated read time, author, and quick share actions.
- Ensure images lazy-load with blur placeholder to maintain performance.
- LLM-generated content must pass verifier before publish; fallback to templated summary if verification fails.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. News feed supports query params for tag filtering (`?tag=portal`).
2. Portal tracker updates at least twice daily and links to relevant team or player pages.
3. Diamond Pro teasers display lock icon and lead to paywall if user lacks entitlement.
4. Newsletter form validates email, stores in marketing list, and never logs PII.
5. Articles older than 30 days archived but remain searchable via global search.
