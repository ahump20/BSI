# Product Directory

This directory contains product documentation for the Diamond Insights pivot.

## Structure

- `ux/` — User experience specifications
  - `IA.md` — Information Architecture
  - `RedirectMap.csv` — Legacy URL redirects
  - `specs/` — Page-level specifications (to be added)

## Purpose

Track design decisions, redirects, and user experience specifications as we pivot from the legacy BSI platform to Diamond Insights.

## Key Documents

- **IA.md**: Complete site structure and navigation hierarchy
- **RedirectMap.csv**: Mapping of legacy URLs to new routes (301 redirects)

## Adding New Specs

When adding new page specifications:

1. Create a new `.md` file in `specs/`
2. Include: purpose, wireframe notes, components needed, acceptance criteria
3. Reference the IA.md for navigation context
