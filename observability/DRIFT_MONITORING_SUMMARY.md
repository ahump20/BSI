- ✅ Type change monitoring with severity classification
- ✅ Schema registry with version history

### 2. Statistical Drift Detection
- ✅ **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test** - For continuous variables (thresholds: 0.1 warning, 0.2 critical)
- ✅ **Population Stability Index** - For categorical data (thresholds: <0.1 no drift, >0.25 significant)
- ✅ **Custom Cardinals Readiness** - Composite OPS+/ERA/Leverage metric
- ✅ **Custom Character Assessment** - Biomechanical confidence and trait stability

### 3. Automated Reporting
- ✅ **Nightly Reports (2 AM CT)** - Comprehensive HTML reports with visualizations
- ✅ **Executive Dashboard** - High-level drift score indicators (green/yellow/red)
- ✅ **30-Day Sparklines** - Trend visualization for each monitored column
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis** - Pattern-based drift explanations

### 4. Issue Management
- ✅ **GitHub Integration** - Auto-created issues for critical drift detection
- ✅ **Severity Classification** - INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL levels with appropriate actions
- ✅ **Structured Templates** - Detailed issue descriptions with statistical evidence
- ✅ **Team Assignment** - Automatic assignment to Austin Humphrey (ahump20)

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- ✅ **Drift Gates** - Build failures on critical drift detection
- ✅ **Override Mechanisms** - Emergency deployment with approval workflows
- ✅ **Baseline Caching** - Performance optimization for faster CI execution
- ✅ **Artifact Storage** - Cloudflare R2 integration for reports and logs

### 6. Cloudflare Analytics Engine Integration
- ✅ **Real-time Metrics** - Live drift statistics streaming
- ✅ **Dashboard API** - Interactive web dashboard at /api/drift/dashboard
- ✅ **Alert Webhooks** - Critical drift notifications
- ✅ **KV Storage** - Critical drift event persistence

## 🚀 Usage Commands

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Run full drift monitoring
npm run drift:monitor

# Generate comprehensive report
npm run drift:report

# Test the monitoring system
npm run test:drift

# Run CI/CD drift gate
npm run drift:ci
```

### CI/CD Integration
