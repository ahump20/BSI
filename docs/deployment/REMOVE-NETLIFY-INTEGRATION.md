# Remove Netlify Integration from GitHub Repository

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Action Required
**Repository:** ahump20/BSI

---

## Summary

All Netlify configuration files have been removed from the BSI repository, and Cloudflare Pages deployment is fully operational. However, the Netlify GitHub App integration remains active, causing Netlify bot to post deployment status comments on pull requests.

**This integration must be manually removed from GitHub repository settings.**

---

## Why Remove Netlify Integration?

1. **Architecture Alignment:** BSI uses Cloudflare-only infrastructure per CLAUDE.md
2. **Deployment Clarity:** Prevents confusion from multiple deployment status notifications
3. **Clean PR Comments:** Eliminates unnecessary Netlify bot comments on PRs
4. **Security Best Practice:** Remove unused third-party app integrations

---

## Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Remove Netlify GitHub App from Repository

1. Navigate to **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to https://github.com/ahump20/BSI/settings

2. Click **Integrations** → **GitHub Apps** in the left sidebar

3. Locate **Netlify** in the list of installed apps

4. Click **Configure** next to Netlify

5. Scroll down and click **Uninstall** (or **Remove** if it shows repository-specific access)

6. Confirm the uninstallation

### Step 2: Remove Netlify Webhooks (if any)

1. In **Repository Settings**, click **Webhooks** in the left sidebar

2. Look for any webhooks pointing to Netlify domains (e.g., `*.netlify.com`)

3. Click **Delete** for each Netlify webhook found

4. Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Verify Removal

After removing the integration:

1. Create a test commit or PR
2. Verify that Netlify bot no longer posts deployment comments
3. Confirm Cloudflare Pages deployment still works via GitHub Actions

## Current Deployment Architecture

### Cloudflare Pages (Active)

**GitHub Action:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

```yaml
- Trigger: Push to main/staging, pull requests
- Build: pnpm build
- Deploy: wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=blazesportsintel
```

**Deployment URLs:**
- Production: https://blazesportsintel.com
- Preview: https://blazesportsintel.pages.dev
- PR Previews: Auto-generated by Cloudflare Pages

### Cloudflare Workers

Multiple workers deployed via:
- Individual `wrangler.toml` files per worker
- Direct deployment via `wrangler deploy` commands
- Separate from Pages deployment
