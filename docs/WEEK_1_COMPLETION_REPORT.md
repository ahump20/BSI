## Questions for Founder

1. **Sitemap Priority:** Which pages should be prioritized for Google indexing first?
   - Current: Methodology (0.9), Competitive (0.9), Data Transparency (0.8)
   - Should we adjust?

2. **Social Sharing Images:** Do you have branded images for Open Graph previews?
   - Recommended size: 1200x630px
   - Should show Diamond Certainty logo or screenshot

3. **Conference Budget:** Can we approve $2,500 for ABCA/AFCA/NCAA registrations?
   - Deadline: Mid-December for January 2026 conventions

4. **Pilot Client Discount:** Confirm 50% Year 1 discount for case study participants?
   - 5 clients × $12k discount = $60k revenue forgone
   - Expected ROI: 6 new clients at full price ($108k ARR)
