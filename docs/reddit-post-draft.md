## Body Text:

I run a college baseball analytics site ([Blaze Sports Intel](https://blazesportsintel.com)) and put together a deep-dive on what the first two weekends actually told us vs. what was just noise. Full piece is here: https://blazesportsintel.com/college-baseball/editorial/what-two-weekends-told-us/

The short version:

**Signal:**

- **UCLA is in a tier by itself.** They're the only top-5 team that faced ranked competition (No. 7 TCU) and won decisively — a 30-8 sweep. The other undefeated top-5 teams (LSU, Texas, Mississippi State, Georgia Tech) haven't faced a ranked opponent yet. Undefeated ≠ tested.

- **The closer-to-starter conversion pipeline is real.** Dylan Volantis at Texas — 2025 SEC Freshman of the Year, 12 saves — moved to the Sunday starter role and has thrown 14 IP, 0 ER, 17 K through two starts. This isn't an isolated experiment. The 34-scholarship era gives programs enough bullpen depth to move their best reliever into the rotation without creating a pen vacuum.

- **Portal players are defining the teams they joined, not just contributing.** Cameron Johnson (LSU → Oklahoma, 11 K on Opening Friday), Caden Sorrell (Maryland → Texas A&M, SEC Player of the Week), Kevin Robbins (Notre Dame → Texas, hit for the cycle). These aren't role players — they're the identity.

**Noise:**

- Run differentials against non-conference opponents (Oklahoma outscored Coppin State 57-1 — that tells you nothing about the SEC)
- Single-game upsets when the ranked team won the series (UAB beat Florida on Opening Day; Florida won the series comfortably)
- Individual stat lines against sub-.300 opponents from last year
- Preseason rankings through two weekends — TCU was No. 7, now they're No. 18; Louisville was No. 8, now unranked

**The five things Weekends 3-6 need to confirm:**

1. UCLA's lineup depth against a fully healthy top-15 rotation
2. Whether Volantis's slider holds up the third time through an SEC lineup
3. Whether the 8 undefeated records survive first contact with ranked opposition
4. Portal hitter production once opponents have advance scouting video
5. Whether Liam Peterson fixes the walk problem (5 BB on Opening Day for the No. 9 overall draft prospect)

I also published draft profiles on the three prospects who stood out most through two weekends if anyone's interested:
- [Roch Cholowsky (UCLA SS, consensus No. 1 pick)](https://blazesportsintel.com/college-baseball/editorial/roch-cholowsky-2026-draft-profile/) — 6 HR in 7 games, 3 HR vs No. 7 TCU
- [Dylan Volantis (Texas LHP)](https://blazesportsintel.com/college-baseball/editorial/dylan-volantis-2026-draft-profile/) — 14 IP, 0 ER, 17 K, closer-to-starter conversion
- [Jackson Flora (UCSB RHP, No. 14 prospect)](https://blazesportsintel.com/college-baseball/editorial/jackson-flora-2026-draft-profile/) — 100 mph, new curveball and changeup, 6 IP / 0 R vs No. 20 Southern Miss

What are you all watching for in Weekend 3? Curious which of these "signal" calls hold up and which ones I'm wrong about.
