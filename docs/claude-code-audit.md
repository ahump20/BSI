# Blaze Sports Intel Deployment Audit

## Summary
- All API endpoints queried (`/api/mlb`, `/api/mlb-standings`) time out or return no data, so previously reported JSON parse fixes are unverified and effectively failing.
- The production dashboard remains stuck in a loading state ("Last update: Never"), confirming frontendâ†”API communication is broken.
- Claimed branding updates and pull-request branches cannot be reviewed because the referenced repository/branch is inaccessible.
- Deployment is not clean: production build is non-functional, implying CI/CD or runtime regression.

## Immediate Actions
1. **Restore observability**
   - Collect Cloudflare Pages/Workers logs plus origin server logs.
   - Enable request/response tracing around API handlers to catch startup/runtime errors.
2. **Recover source access**
   - Regain access to the `fix/prod-api-and-dashboard` branch (or equivalent) so the team can diff, test, and redeploy.
   - Mirror critical repos into Blaze Intelligence-owned remotes to avoid single points of failure.
3. **Revalidate API + frontend contract**
   - Stand up a staging environment; confirm query-string endpoints return JSON with schema validation (Zod/Pydantic) before promoting to prod.
   - Add integration tests that exercise `/api/mlb`, `/api/mlb-standings`, and corresponding frontend fetch calls.
4. **Tighten deployment gates**
   - Require smoke tests post-deploy (API health checks + dashboard data load) and block release on failures.
   - Attach evidence (functional URL, PR link, CI logs) to future status reports.

## Follow-Up Tasks
- Run post-mortem covering QA gaps and misreporting to reset Definition of Done.
- Implement incident response checklist so future outages surface instantly.
- Audit branding/theme assets after functionality is restored.
