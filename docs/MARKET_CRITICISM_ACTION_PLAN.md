## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Pilot Programs Fail to Show ROI
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-qualify programs with baseline > .450 win % (room for improvement)
- Focus on measurable quick wins (injury prevention, game prep time)
- Overpromise on support: weekly check-ins, custom training

### Risk 2: Peer Review Rejection
**Mitigation:**
- Start with lower-tier journals (not top-5 initially)
- Focus on methodology transparency rather than revolutionary claims
- Use validation study as "working paper" even if not published (preprint on arXiv)

### Risk 3: Competitors Copy Approach
**Mitigation:**
- Patent pending on Diamond Certainty weighting algorithm
- First-mover advantage: establish category leadership before copycats
- Network effects: more data = better models = harder to replicate

## Conclusion

The market criticisms are valid but addressable. Our action plan focuses on:

1. **Transparency over secrecy** â€” Publish methodology, invite scrutiny
2. **Validation over hype** â€” Academic partnerships, peer review, open datasets
3. **ROI proof over promises** â€” Case studies with measurable financial impact
4. **Education over advertising** â€” Content marketing, conference talks, thought leadership

**Key Insight:** The criticisms themselves become our marketing strategy. Competitors hide behind proprietary algorithms. We show our math. Competitors promise results. We publish validated case studies. Competitors target billion-dollar franchises. We democratize access.

**Next Action:** Review this plan with founder, prioritize top 3 actions for immediate execution, assign owners, set 30-day check-in.
