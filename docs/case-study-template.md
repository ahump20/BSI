### 6. Financial ROI Calculation

#### Direct Cost Savings
| Category | Annual Savings | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Medical/Injury Prevention | $380,000 | 2 Tommy John surgeries avoided @ $150k + rehab |
| Recruiting Efficiency | $95,000 | Reduced scouting travel (3 fewer nationwide trips @ $8k each) + staff time |
| Wasted Scholarships | $120,000 | 1 recruit bust avoided @ $30k/year × 4 years |
| Staff Productivity | $42,000 | 5 hours/week saved on film/analytics × 30 weeks @ $28/hr |
| **Total Direct Savings** | **$637,000** | |

#### Revenue Gains
| Category | Annual Gain | Evidence |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Postseason Revenue | $250,000 | Regional hosting (ticket sales + NCAA payout) |
| Donor Engagement | $180,000 | 18% increase in major gifts tied to winning |
| Player Draft Value | $1.2M+ | 2 players drafted higher than projected (signing bonuses) |
| **Total Revenue Gain** | **$1.63M** | |

#### Platform Cost
- **Blaze Subscription:** $24,000/year (Diamond Pro tier)
- **Hardware Integration:** $8,000 (one-time setup)
- **Staff Training:** $3,500

**Net ROI (Year 1):**
```
(Total Savings + Revenue Gains - Platform Cost) / Platform Cost
= ($637,000 + $1,630,000 - $35,500) / $35,500
= 6,345% ROI
```

**Note:** Revenue gains are correlation, not pure causation. Conservative attribution: 30% of revenue gains directly from Blaze insights.

**Conservative Net ROI (Year 1):**
```
($637,000 + $489,000 - $35,500) / $35,500 = 3,065% ROI
```

### 9. Lessons Learned & Best Practices

#### What Worked
1. **Start with one sport/feature:** Don't overwhelm staff—pilot with baseball before expanding
2. **Coach buy-in critical:** Designate "Blaze champion" on staff who evangelizes platform
3. **Recruit validation:** Show coaches 3-5 historical examples where intangibles predicted outcomes
4. **Live demo during games:** Real-time bullpen alerts during high-leverage situations prove value instantly

#### What Didn't Work
1. **Over-reliance on scores:** Some coaches initially ignored scouting instincts—balance data + experience
2. **Hardware setup:** Initial biomechanics camera setup took 3 weeks vs. estimated 1 week
3. **Player privacy concerns:** Needed clear policy on how mental fortress scores are communicated

### 10. Scalability & Future Plans

- **Expansion to other sports:** Adding football recruiting intelligence (2025)
- **NIL marketplace integration:** Direct athlete-brand matching via platform
- **Alumni network:** Using Diamond Certainty for professional player tracking
- **High school partnerships:** Early identification pipeline starting at 9th grade
