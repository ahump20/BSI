# Blaze Sports Intel — Brand Story (living doc)

Use this file as the single source of truth for tone, themes, and origin story.

## Non-negotiables
- The coverage ESPN won't give you.
- Texas isn't just a place — it's a covenant: treat people right, root for underdogs, never stop dreaming beyond the horizon.
- Authenticity over polish. Substance over flash.

## Origin anchors (expand as needed)
- Named after Blaze (the dog), inspired by the "Bartlett Blaze" — first baseball team.
- Family legacy: decades of Longhorn football pilgrimage; four season tickets older than my lifespan.
- Born in Memphis, TN — on Texas soil placed beneath the hospital bed from West Columbia (birthplace of the Republic of Texas).
- Doctor's line that sets the tone: "You know you ain't the first to do this — but they've ALL been from Texas."

## Voice rules for copy
- Direct. Concrete. No buzzwords.
- Proof > hype.
- If we don't know it, we don't pretend we do.
