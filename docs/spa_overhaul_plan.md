# Blaze Intelligence Sports Analytics SPA Overhaul Plan

## Objective
Deliver a production-grade, single-page application for Blaze Intelligence that visualizes live and historical sports analytics using authentic data sources. The app must meet the organization's global priorities, maintain legal compliance, and scale for future features.

## Scope Summary
- **Modules impacted**: frontend SPA (React + TypeScript), backend data services (FastAPI + Postgres), ETL pipelines, infrastructure (Docker/K8s), observability stack.
- **Change classification**: `feat` (new SPA), `infra` (data ingestion + deployment), `docs` (operational guidance).

## Functional Requirements
1. **Real Sports Data Integration**
   - Source: Major League Baseball (MLB), National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), NCAA Track & Field public APIs and data feeds. Prioritize official or licensed third-party providers (e.g., Sportradar, Stats Perform, College archives).
   - Data freshness: ingest live play-by-play updates (≤5s latency target) and maintain historical archives (10+ years) for trend analysis.
   - Normalize schema across sports for comparative analytics and cross-sport dashboards.

2. **Dynamic Analytics & Visualizations**
   - Provide dashboards for each sport featuring advanced metrics (e.g., MLB expected wOBA, NFL EPA/play, NBA RAPTOR, Track & Field split differentials).
   - Implement interactive charts (D3/Recharts), real-time win probability gauges, Monte Carlo outcome simulations (WebGL/Three.js for 3D visuals), and customizable alerts.
   - Offer comparisons Baseball → Football → Basketball → Track & Field per domain rules.

3. **User Experience & Accessibility**
   - SPA built with React 18, TypeScript strict mode, Next.js or Vite bundler.
   - Ensure WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, responsive layout, keyboard navigation, ARIA labeling, and themeable design system.
   - Provide secure authentication (OIDC) with RBAC controlling premium analytics.

4. **Legal & Compliance**
   - Ensure data provider licensing agreements permit redistribution.
   - Obey gambling regulations; include disclaimers and geolocation-based feature gating where required.
   - Maintain audit logging for data provenance, API usage, and user interactions impacting compliance.

## Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript (strict), Vite build system, Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching with caching, React Router for client routing.
- **State Management**: RTK Query for API slices, Zustand for local UI state.
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for custom charts, Recharts for rapid components, Three.js for 3D simulations.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theming; integrate Headless UI for accessible primitives.
- **Analytics Engine**: Web Workers for heavy computations; integrate WASM modules for Monte Carlo simulations to meet performance requirements.

### Backend
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI service exposing REST + GraphQL endpoints secured via OAuth2/OIDC.
- **Data Services**: Microservices for each sport, orchestrated via Kafka for event streaming. Postgres for relational storage, TimescaleDB extension for time-series metrics, Redis for caching.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Python workers (Celery) ingesting live feeds, validating via Pydantic models, storing raw + curated layers in data lake (S3-compatible storage) and warehouse (Snowflake/Postgres).
- **Compliance Logging**: Structured logging (JSON) with OpenTelemetry traces, metrics exported to Prometheus/Grafana.

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker images per service, orchestrated via Kubernetes with Helm charts. Utilize GitHub Actions for CI/CD, integrating unit/integration tests, linting, security scans (Snyk, Trivy).
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager; environment variables injected at runtime.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry collector, Jaeger tracing, Loki logging, Grafana dashboards with sport-specific KPIs.
- **Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on API throughput and ingestion latency; CDN (Cloudflare) for frontend assets.

## Data Model Strategy
- Unified schema with core entities: `Team`, `Athlete`, `Game`, `Event`, `Metric`.
- Sport-specific extension tables: `mlb_pitch_events`, `nfl_drive_events`, `nba_possessions`, `track_split_times`.
- Partitioned tables by season for performance; indexes on high-cardinality keys (athlete_id, game_id, timestamp).
- Data warehouse materialized views for aggregated metrics (e.g., rolling averages, per-possession stats).

## Security & Privacy Controls
- Input validation via Zod (frontend) and Pydantic (backend).
- Enforce RBAC: Admin, Analyst, Viewer roles; least privilege by default.
- Rate limiting and API keys per partner feed to prevent abuse.
- Implement CSP, HSTS, secure cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite=strict), JWT rotation, CSRF protection for mutations.
- Continuous dependency scanning, SBOM generation, signed container images (Cosign).

## Testing & Quality Gates
- **Frontend**: Vitest + React Testing Library; Cypress for end-to-end flows; Lighthouse CI for accessibility/performance; Pa11y for accessibility regression.
- **Backend**: Pytest with coverage ≥90% on changed code; contract tests for external APIs using Pact.
- **Data Pipelines**: Great Expectations for data validation; property-based tests for simulation models.
- **CI/CD**: Pre-commit hooks enforcing ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, Black, isort.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Foundational Setup (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Audit existing repository, remove obsolete assets, bootstrap monorepo (PNPM workspaces) for frontend/backend.
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline, container registry, and infrastructure as code (Terraform) for core services.
2. **Data Integration (Weeks 2-6)**
   - Secure data provider contracts, implement ingestion adapters per sport with mock integration tests.
   - Create normalized schemas, migrations, and initial data backfill scripts.
3. **Backend Services (Weeks 4-8)**
   - Build FastAPI services with endpoints for live stats, historical queries, and analytics computations.
   - Implement caching, rate limits, and observability instrumentation.
4. **Frontend Development (Weeks 6-12)**
   - Develop UI shell, navigation, authentication flows, and dashboards per sport.
   - Integrate real-time updates via WebSockets/Server-Sent Events; build interactive charts and simulations.
5. **Testing & Hardening (Weeks 10-14)**
   - Comprehensive testing, load/performance benchmarking, security penetration testing.
   - Accessibility review, legal compliance checklist, red-team tabletop exercises.
6. **Launch & Monitoring (Weeks 14-16)**
   - Blue/green deployment, post-launch monitoring, user feedback loop, iterative improvements.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Licensing**: Engage legal team early; maintain compliance documentation and automated usage reports.
- **Scalability**: Load-test ingestion and API layers; implement circuit breakers for upstream outages.
- **Security**: Conduct threat modeling (STRIDE), regular dependency patching, bug bounty program.
- **Team Alignment**: Weekly cross-functional syncs, shared dashboards, and clear ownership matrix (RACI).

## Deliverables
- Production-ready SPA with authenticated access and sport-specific dashboards.
- Automated data ingestion pipelines with observability dashboards.
- Comprehensive documentation: architecture diagrams, runbooks, compliance logs, onboarding guides.
- Post-launch metrics: latency <200ms for cached queries, uptime ≥99.9%, data accuracy ≥99.5%.

## Next Steps
- Approve roadmap and allocate engineering/legal budget.
- Schedule discovery sessions with data providers and internal stakeholders.
- Kick off foundational setup sprint focusing on repo hygiene and CI/CD automation.
