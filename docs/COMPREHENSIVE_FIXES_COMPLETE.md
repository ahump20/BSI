## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. Team Navigation Fixed ✅
**Problem**: Clicking team cards reloaded the page instead of showing team details
**Root Cause**: Default `activeView` was set to 'monte-carlo', rendering teams in wrong component context
**Fix**: Changed `useState('monte-carlo')` to `useState('sport-data')` at analytics.html:2786
**Result**: Team navigation now works correctly across all sports
**Deployment**: https://cc0ffe86.blazesportsintel.pages.dev

---

### 2. NFL Divisions Showing "Unknown" Fixed ✅
**Problem**: All NFL teams displayed "Unknown" for division/conference
**Root Cause**: ESPN standings API doesn't include team division information
**Fix**: Added comprehensive NFL_DIVISIONS mapping with all 32 teams and their divisions
**Location**: functions/api/nfl/standings.js:73-121
**Result**: NFL divisions now display correctly:
- AFC East, AFC North, AFC South, AFC West
- NFC East, NFC North, NFC South, NFC West

**Verification**:
```bash
curl -s "https://blazesportsintel.com/api/nfl/standings" | jq '.standings[0].divisions[0].teams[0]'
# Returns: { "division": "AFC South", "name": "Indianapolis Colts", ... }
```

**Deployment**: https://261c1772.blazesportsintel.pages.dev

---

### 3. CFB/CBB Pages Not Loading Fixed ✅
**Problem**: College Football and College Basketball pages were completely blank
**Root Cause**: Frontend expected `data.teams[]` but SportsDataIO APIs return `{ data: [...], meta: {...} }`
**Fix**: Added format detection and normalization in `fetchTeams()` function
**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// analytics.html:2836-2842
} else if ((sport === 'CFB' || sport === 'CBB') && data.data) {
    // SportsDataIO format: { data: [...], meta: {...} }
    setTeams(data.data || []);
    console.log(`✅ Loaded ${data.data.length} ${sport} teams from API`);
}
```

**Result**: CFB shows 272 teams, CBB fully functional
**API Verification**: `curl https://blazesportsintel.com/api/cfb/teams` returns 272 teams

---

### 4. Standings Tab Implemented ✅
**Problem**: Standings tab showed placeholder "coming soon" message
**Fix**: Complete standings implementation with:
- Added `standings` state variable
- Created `fetchStandings()` function for all sports
- Built comprehensive standings table UI
- Handles both ESPN (NFL/MLB/NBA) and SportsDataIO (CFB/CBB) formats

**Features**:
- Conference/division breakdown
- Win/loss records, win percentage
- Games back calculation
- Streak display
- Clickable rows to view team details
- Hover effects for better UX

**Code**:
- Fetch function: analytics.html:2900-2946
- UI rendering: analytics.html:3309-3403

---

### 5. Team Data Normalization ✅
**Problem**: Different API formats caused display issues
**Fix**: Universal team card rendering that handles:
- **ESPN format**: `displayName`, `abbreviation`, `logos[0].href`, `division`
- **SportsDataIO format**: `Name`, `School`, `Key`, `TeamLogoUrl`, `Conference`, `Division`

**Normalization Logic** (analytics.html:3173-3201):
```javascript
const teamName = team.name || team.displayName || team.Name || team.School || 'Unknown Team';
const teamAbbr = team.abbreviation || team.Key || team.Abbreviation || 'N/A';
const teamLogo = team.logos?.[0]?.href || team.logo || team.TeamLogoUrl || null;
const teamDivision = team.division || team.conference || team.Division || team.Conference || 'Unknown';
```

**Result**: All sports display correctly with proper logos, names, divisions

---

### 6. Schedule Tab Working ✅
**Status**: Already functional after data handling fixes
**Features**:
- Real-time game data
- Date/time display
- Score display
- Game status (scheduled/in-progress/final)
- Team names and matchups
