## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Domain Authority (est.) | Coverage Depth | BSI Differentiation |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1Baseball | High | Rankings, scores, news, prospects | No player-level analytics pages |
| Baseball America | High | Rankings, scouting, draft board | Paywalled — BSI can rank on free terms |
| ESPN | Very High | Broad coverage, scores, rankings | No dedicated analytics pages per player |
| NCAA.com | Very High (edu-level) | Official stats and rankings | Raw stats only, no scouting analytics |
| Baseball-Reference | High | Historical stats, box scores | No college-specific analytics framework |
| 64 Analytics | Medium | Transfer portal analytics, metrics | Direct competitor in analytics niche |
| Just Baseball | Medium | Prospect coverage, rankings | Growing but thin on analytics depth |

**Key gap:** No consumer product provides HAV-F-style composite player analytics for individual college baseball players. D1Baseball has prospect profiles but not quantified scouting composites. 64 Analytics covers transfer portal metrics but not player-level scouting analytics pages.

## 20 Target Keywords — Assessed

### Tier 1: High Opportunity (player-specific long-tail)

These are the SEO beachhead. No one is building dedicated analytics pages for individual college players. BSI's pre-rendered player pages with HAV-F scores, structured data, and JSON-LD can rank.

| Keyword | Est. Difficulty | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| "Roch Cholowsky stats" | Low-Medium | Wikipedia + UCLA + BA exist, but no analytics-focused page |
| "Jacob Jarrell stats Clemson" | Low | Clemson athletics + BA, but thin competition |
| "Ace Reese Mississippi State stats" | Low | Very thin SERP — BSI can own this |
| "Blake Bevis stats" | Very Low | Almost no competition |
| "Cash Strayer Florida stats" | Very Low | Almost no competition |
| "Luke Gaffney Clemson baseball" | Very Low | Almost no competition |
| "Wesley Jordan Texas A&M baseball stats" | Very Low | Almost no competition |

**Action:** BSI already has 15 pre-rendered player pages with HAV-F data. Submit to Search Console immediately.

### Tier 2: Medium Opportunity (analytics niche)

These terms have moderate competition but BSI has unique content that doesn't exist elsewhere.

| Keyword | Est. Difficulty | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| "college baseball analytics" | Medium | GoRout, SABR, 64 Analytics compete. BSI has HAV-F methodology page. |
| "college baseball scouting analytics" | Low-Medium | Very few results — BSI can define the category |
| "college baseball player analytics" | Low | Thin SERP, no dominant player |
| "HAV-F analytics" | Very Low | BSI owns this term completely |
| "college baseball draft analytics 2026" | Medium | ESPN/BA dominate "draft prospects" but not "analytics" modifier |
| "college baseball win probability" | Low | FanGraphs has MLB version; no college equivalent exists |

**Action:** Create methodology/explainer pages for HAV-F and BSI's analytics framework. These become citation targets.

### Tier 3: Moderate Opportunity (content pages)

Competitive but BSI has content that matches search intent.

| Keyword | Est. Difficulty | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| "college baseball transfer portal 2026" | Medium-High | 64 Analytics, D1Baseball, BA compete heavily |
| "SEC baseball standings 2026" | Medium | ESPN, D1Baseball, NCAA.com dominate |
| "college baseball rankings 2026" | High | ESPN, D1Baseball, BA, NCAA.com all rank |
| "college baseball scores today" | Very High | ESPN, NCAA.com, D1Baseball own this |
| "college baseball stats" | Very High | Baseball-Reference, NCAA.com, The Baseball Cube |

**Action:** Don't prioritize these for organic — BSI's pages exist for user experience, not SEO dominance.

### Tier 4: Conference-Specific (moderate long-tail)

| Keyword | Est. Difficulty | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| "Big 12 baseball standings 2026" | Medium | Fewer competitors than SEC |
| "Big Ten baseball 2026 preview" | Medium | Relatively new conference alignment, fewer established pages |

**Action:** BSI's editorial hub already has conference pages. Internal linking from player pages → conference pages builds authority.

---

## Priority Ranking

1. **Tier 1 player-specific terms** — immediate, 15 pages already live
2. **Tier 2 analytics niche** — create HAV-F methodology page, link from player pages
3. **Tier 4 conference terms** — editorial hub already covers, needs internal linking
4. **Tier 3 content pages** — exist for UX, SEO is bonus

---

## Upgrade Path

Run these terms through Ubersuggest (free tier) or Ahrefs Site Explorer (free webmaster tools) to get actual keyword difficulty scores and search volume estimates. The SERP-based assessment above is directional — real numbers would upgrade Assumption A1 from "Untested" to "Tested."

**Google Search Console:** Verify blazesportsintel.com, submit sitemap (168 URLs including 15 player pages). After 30 days, measure:
- Impressions per keyword
- Click-through rate
- Average position
- Which player pages index first

## Competitor to Watch: 64 Analytics

64analytics.com offers college baseball transfer portal analytics with a subscription model ($9.99/month for Portal Pass). They have:
- Player comparison tools
- Hitting/pitching metrics
- Transfer portal alerts
- Team impact rankings

BSI differentiates by offering HAV-F composite scores (unique metric), free player analytics pages (no paywall on individual profiles), and cross-sport coverage. 64 Analytics is baseball-only.
