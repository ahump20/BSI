# Keyword Research — Week 1 Deliverable (completed Feb 25)

## Method
Web search analysis of target terms to assess competition density and BSI differentiation.
Full Ahrefs/SEMrush audit still needed for difficulty scores — this is the directional read.

## Target Terms and Competitive Landscape

### Player-Specific (Long-Tail — Primary SEO Targets)

| Term | Competition | BSI Differentiation | Assessment |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| "roch cholowsky 2026 draft" | High — Just Baseball, MLB.com, SI, Bleacher Nation, BA, CBS Sports | Scouting grades (20-80), UCLA lineup context, game log tables | Crowded but BSI angle is unique |
| "dylan volantis 2026" | Low-Medium — TexasLonghorns.com, Daily Texan, Burnt Orange Nation, Yahoo | Closer-to-starter conversion analysis, draft stock economics | **Best opportunity.** Local/beat coverage only; no national analytical profile exists. |
| "jackson flora UCSB draft" | Medium — BA, Federal Baseball, ESPN, Sox Machine | Four-pitch arsenal development, secondary pitch grading | Arsenal development angle is differentiated |
| "college baseball draft prospects 2026" | Very High — BA, ESPN, MLB Pipeline, D1Baseball | Not competitive at this term; go long-tail on individual names | Avoid — can't outrank BA/ESPN |

### Analytical (Medium-Tail — Reddit/Social Targets)

| Term | Competition | BSI Differentiation | Assessment |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| "college baseball analytics 2026" | High — BA, ESPN, D1Baseball, 64Analytics, Warren Nolan | Signal-vs-noise meta-analysis; no one else does this | Moderate opportunity; need backlinks |
| "college baseball transfer portal impact" | High — BA, Just Baseball, 64Analytics | Measured portal impact against advance scouting | Moderate; 64Analytics is direct competitor |
| "college baseball pitching stats 2026" | Medium — NCAA.com, Warren Nolan, BA | Framework-level analysis (role conversion trend) | Good opportunity for analytical content |
| "college baseball signal noise early season" | Very Low — no one targets this | **BSI owns this concept** | **Best analytical opportunity** |

### Program-Specific (Long-Tail — Existing Content)

| Term | Competition | BSI Differentiation | Assessment |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| "texas longhorns baseball 2026" | Medium — TexasLonghorns.com, BON, Daily Texan | Deep analytical preview + weekly recaps | Good; local outlets don't do analytics |
| "UCLA baseball 2026" | Medium — UCLA athletics, Bruin Report Online | Cholowsky profile drives traffic to team page | Good; no national analytical UCLA coverage |
| "SEC baseball 2026 preview" | High — BA, ESPN, D1Baseball | Full 16-team preview series | Moderate; existing previews are strong |

## Key Finding: Assumption A1 (Low SEO Competition) — Partially Confirmed

**Player names** have low-to-medium competition for analytical content. The major outlets (BA, ESPN) produce rankings and scouting reports but not the kind of deep analytical profiles with scouting grades, game logs, and statistical frameworks that BSI is publishing. The differentiation is real.

**Generic terms** ("college baseball analytics", "college baseball draft prospects") are dominated by established publications. BSI cannot compete at these terms without significant domain authority.

**The strategy that works:** Long-tail player names + analytical framework terms. "Dylan Volantis closer to starter conversion" has zero competition. "Roch Cholowsky scouting grades" has zero competition. These are the terms where BSI can rank.

## Recommended Week 3-4 Actions

1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console ✅ (already submitted; updated sitemap live with 134 URLs)
2. Monitor Search Console impressions for player name terms starting Day 30
3. Internal linking between draft profiles and weekly recaps (already done in the articles)
4. Reddit post drives initial referral traffic and potential backlinks
5. Next player profiles should target the "medium competition" names: Liam Peterson (Florida), Tyce Armstrong (Baylor — 3 grand slams), Cam Kozeal (Arkansas — cycle)
