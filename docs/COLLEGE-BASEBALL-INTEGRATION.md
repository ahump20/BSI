## Deployment & Operations

### Caching Configuration

```javascript
// Live game updates
Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-while-revalidate=15

// Box scores (live)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=15, stale-while-revalidate=10

// Box scores (final)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=300

// Standings
Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=60
```

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- API response times (target: <200ms p95 cached)
- Cache hit ratio (target: >80%)
- Data staleness incidents (target: <1% per week)
- Scraper failure rate
- User engagement (DAU, session length)

**Alerting**:
- Scraper failures → Slack notification
- API errors > 5% → PagerDuty alert
- Cache miss ratio > 50% → Investigate

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Reliability Risk

**Risk**: Scrapers break frequently; live games show stale data

**Mitigation**:
- Multiple data source fallbacks
- Automatic scraper health checks
- Commercial API as primary by Month 6
- Real-time alerting on staleness
- Engineering time allocated for rapid fixes

### Seasonal Demand Risk

**Risk**: Heavy spring/postseason spikes, low off-season engagement

**Mitigation**:
- Scale infrastructure for traffic surges
- Aggressive caching strategy
- Off-season content: prospect tracking, MLB draft ties
- Early softball expansion to smooth seasonality
- Multi-sport bundle strategy

### Monetization Sensitivity Risk

**Risk**: Fans distrust paywalls after poor past experiences

**Mitigation**:
- Transparent value proposition
- 14-day free trial for Diamond Pro
- Free tier remains valuable
- Community-first approach
- No artificial limitations on basic features

### Competitive Response Risk

**Risk**: ESPN or incumbents improve college baseball coverage

**Mitigation**:
- Own the fan relationship via community
- UX moat with mobile-first design
- Faster feature velocity
- Exclusive content partnerships
- Regional/conference-specific depth
