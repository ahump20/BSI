## Build Metrics

### Bundle Analysis (Vite Production Build)

| Asset | Size (Uncompressed) | Size (Gzipped) | Status |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| **App Code** (`index-*.js`) | 21.18 KB | **7.03 KB** | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **React Vendor** (`react-vendor-*.js`) | 313.57 KB | **96.42 KB** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Large (expected) |
| **CSS** (`index-*.css`) | 2.50 KB | **0.98 KB** | ‚úÖ Minimal |
| **Total** | 337.15 KB | **104.43 KB** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Above 65KB target |

### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ App code is only **7KB gzipped** - exceptionally lightweight
- ‚úÖ CSS is minimal at **0.98KB gzipped**
- ‚úÖ Code splitting successfully separates vendor bundle from app code
- ‚úÖ Vendor bundle will be cached across pages (one-time download)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è React 18 + ReactDOM vendor bundle is **96KB gzipped** (expected but large)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Total initial load is **104KB gzipped**, exceeding 65KB mobile-first target
- üí° Consider Preact (~4KB) as React alternative for future optimization

## Deployment Configuration

### Cloudflare Pages Setup

```toml
name = "college-baseball-tracker"
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"
compatibility_date = "2025-01-01"

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "KV", id = "a53c3726fc3044be82e79d2d1e371d26" }
]

[vars]
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

### Vite Configuration

**Key Optimizations:**
- ‚úÖ Sourcemaps disabled in production (`sourcemap: false`)
- ‚úÖ esbuild minification enabled
- ‚úÖ Manual chunks for React vendor bundle
- ‚úÖ Gzip compression via Cloudflare CDN

```javascript
build: {
  outDir: 'dist',
  sourcemap: false,
  minify: 'esbuild',
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        'react-vendor': ['react', 'react-dom']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## React Application Architecture

### Entry Point (`src/main.jsx`)

- **Framework**: React 18.2.0
- **Rendering**: Strict Mode enabled for development warnings
- **Mounting**: `ReactDOM.createRoot()` API

- ‚úÖ Loading state with spinner animation
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Data source attribution (ESPN API + timestamp)
- ‚úÖ America/Chicago timezone display
- ‚úÖ Responsive grid layout (mobile ‚Üí tablet ‚Üí desktop)

**API Integration:**
```javascript
fetch('https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/baseball/college-baseball/scoreboard')
```

### Styling (`src/index.css`)

**Mobile-First Design:**
- ‚úÖ Dark theme (#1a1a1a background)
- ‚úÖ System font stack for performance
- ‚úÖ Responsive breakpoints: 640px, 1024px
- ‚úÖ Smooth hover animations
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner with CSS animation
- ‚úÖ Minimal color palette (white, gray, green accent)

## Performance Targets vs. Actual

### Targets (from Design Standards)

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Bundle Size (Baseball) | 65 KB gzipped | ‚ö†Ô∏è 104 KB (exceeded) |
| Load Time (4G) | <2 seconds | ‚è≥ Not yet measured |
| Lighthouse Performance | 90+ | ‚è≥ Not yet measured |
| Lighthouse Accessibility | 95+ | ‚è≥ Not yet measured |
| First Contentful Paint | <1.8s | ‚è≥ Not yet measured |
| Time to Interactive | <3.5s | ‚è≥ Not yet measured |

### Measurement Blockers

**Issue**: Automated Lighthouse audits failed due to:
1. Brand new deployment (Google PageSpeed Insights not yet indexed)
2. Local Lighthouse CLI installation issues
3. Preview URL not yet cached/optimized by Cloudflare CDN

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to index the site
2. Use manual Chrome DevTools Lighthouse audit
3. Install Lighthouse via Docker for consistent auditing
4. Set up Lighthouse CI for automated PR checks

## Manual Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Deployment Verification

- [x] Site responds with HTTP 200 OK
- [x] HTML title renders correctly ("College Baseball Live")
- [x] Security headers present (X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- [x] Cache-Control headers configured
- [x] CORS headers enabled for API calls
- [x] No 404 errors for static assets

### ‚úÖ Functional Testing

- [x] React app mounts without errors
- [x] Loading spinner displays during data fetch
- [x] ESPN API integration works (live scores load)
- [x] Error handling displays when API fails
- [x] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- [x] Data source attribution displayed

### üìã Manual Performance Testing (To Be Completed)

- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Lighthouse tab
- [ ] Run audit with "Mobile" device setting
- [ ] Run audit with "Simulated throttling" (4G connection)
- [ ] Record Performance score
- [ ] Record Accessibility score

- [ ] Test on iPad Mini (768px width)
- [ ] Verify touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Verify text is readable without zoom
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Test auto-refresh behavior

## Known Issues

### 1. Bundle Size Exceeds Target

**Issue**: 104KB gzipped total (target: 65KB)
**Root Cause**: React 18 + ReactDOM inherently large (96KB gzipped)
**Impact**: Slower initial load on 3G connections

**Potential Solutions:**
1. **Switch to Preact** (~4KB gzipped)
   - Compatible with React API
   - Would reduce total to ~11KB gzipped
   - Requires testing for compatibility

2. **Lazy load React vendor chunk**
   - Load spinner with vanilla JS
   - Defer React bundle until after First Contentful Paint
   - Requires architectural changes

3. **Accept React size for baseball, optimize for football**
   - Shared vendor chunk amortizes cost across sports
   - Focus optimization on football-specific code

**Recommendation**: Accept React size for Phase 1, evaluate Preact for football addition if bundle exceeds 150KB.

---

### 2. Lighthouse Audits Not Yet Run

**Issue**: Cannot run automated performance audits
**Root Cause**: New deployment not indexed, local Lighthouse CLI issues
**Impact**: No baseline metrics for comparison

**Workaround**: Manual Chrome DevTools Lighthouse audit

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2: Football Development)

### Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)

1. **Run manual Lighthouse audit** in Chrome DevTools
2. **Document baseline performance scores** in this file
3. **Test on real mobile devices** (iPhone, Android)
4. **Fix any accessibility issues** discovered in audit
5. **Set up Lighthouse CI** for automated checks

### Football Architecture Planning (Next 30 Days)

1. **Create `/public/football/` directory structure**
2. **Build football API wrappers** in `/functions/api/football/`
3. **Design separate React entry point** (`src/football/main.jsx`)
4. **Configure Vite multi-page build** for separate sport bundles
5. **Implement seasonal routing** via Cloudflare Workers middleware

### Bundle Optimization Strategy

**Target for Dual-Sport Platform:**
- Baseball bundle: 7KB app + 96KB vendor = 103KB
- Football bundle: 30KB app + 96KB vendor = 126KB (shared)
- **Total unique code**: 37KB (7KB + 30KB)
- **Amortized cost**: First sport 103KB, second sport +30KB

**Acceptable if**: Both sports share vendor bundle, football code <30KB

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: React build is functional, deployed, and ready for real-world testing.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Bundle size exceeded target** but is acceptable for React-based architecture. App code is exceptionally lean at 7KB gzipped.

‚è≥ **Performance metrics pending** automated Lighthouse audits. Manual testing required.

üöÄ **Ready for Phase 2**: Football development can proceed with confidence in baseball platform stability.
