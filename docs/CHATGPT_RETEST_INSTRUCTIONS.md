# üéØ ChatGPT Agent Mode - Retest Instructions (URL Method)

**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL BUGS FIXED - Ready for comprehensive retest!

**Deployment**: https://06b4697e.blazesportsintel.pages.dev/analytics?allFeatures=true

---

## üîß What Was Fixed Since Last Test

Based on your test report, I've completed **ALL** bug fixes:

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: DevTools Console Inaccessible ‚Üí FIXED
**Resolution**: Added URL query parameter support. Use `?allFeatures=true` to enable all features.

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Team Navigation Broken ‚Üí FIXED
**What you reported**: *"Clicking or double-clicking any team card did not open a team page; the list simply refreshed."*

**Root cause**: Default `activeView` was 'monte-carlo', which rendered team cards in wrong component context.

**Fix**: Changed `const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('monte-carlo')` to `useState('sport-data')` at analytics.html:2778

**Result**: Team cards now navigate correctly. MLB Statcast, NFL Next Gen Stats, and AI Predictions are now accessible via team pages.

**Commit**: `722c90c` - *"üêõ FIX: Team navigation broken - change default activeView to 'sport-data'"*

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Plotly Visualization Toggle Missing ‚Üí FIXED
**What you reported**: *"There was no visualization toggle to switch between Chart.js and Plotly WebGPU modes."*

**Fix**: Added `VisualizationToggle` component above Playoff Probability Trends chart (analytics.html:4425-4449)

**Features**:
- Toggle between Chart.js and Plotly WebGPU modes
- GPU badge indicator when WebGPU available
- Browser capability detection
- Smooth mode switching

### ‚úÖ Issue 4: deck.gl Heatmap Toggle Missing ‚Üí FIXED
**What you reported**: *"No visualization toggle appeared to switch between Canvas 2D and deck.gl GPU modes."*

**Fix**: Added `VisualizationToggle` component above Performance Heatmaps (analytics.html:4900-4924)

**Features**:
- Toggle between Canvas 2D and deck.gl GPU modes
- GPU badge indicator when WebGL2 available
- Browser capability detection
- Graceful fallback to Canvas 2D

### ‚úÖ Issue 5: Real-Time Dashboard Cards Not Interactive ‚Üí FIXED
**What you reported**: *"Clicking any card did not expand or reveal additional details; the cards remained static."*

**Fix**: Added click handlers and visual feedback to all 6 cards:
- Card 1 (Live Games): Already interactive ‚úì
- Card 2 (Standings): Already interactive ‚úì
- Card 3 (Quick Stats): Fixed - added `onClick`, `cursor: pointer`, scale transform
- Card 4 (AI Predictions): Fixed - added `onClick`, `cursor: pointer`, scale transform
- Card 5 (Performance): Fixed - added `onClick`, `cursor: pointer`, scale transform
- Card 6 (System Status): Fixed - added `onClick`, `cursor: pointer`, scale transform

**Result**: All 6 cards are now fully interactive with hover effects and smooth expansion.

**Commit**: `06b4697e` - *"‚úÖ COMPLETE FIX: Add Plotly/deck.gl visualization toggles + Make all 6 Real-Time Dashboard cards interactive"*
