---

## What Was Built

### 1. Comprehensive Database Schema (`db/schema.sql`)

A production-ready schema with **15 tables**, **3 views**, and **5 triggers**:

#### Core Tables
- **`seasons`** - Track college baseball seasons (2020-2025+)
- **`conferences`** - NCAA conference metadata with tournament bid info
- **`teams`** - College baseball programs with conference affiliations
- **`players`** - Individual player records with draft history
- **`team_rosters`** - Player-team relationships by season

#### Game & Performance Tables
- **`games`** - Game results with venue, broadcast, and weather data
- **`box_scores`** - Game-level aggregated statistics
- **`batting_stats`** - Individual batting performances per game
- **`pitching_stats`** - Individual pitching performances per game

#### Aggregate Tables
- **`team_season_stats`** - Aggregated team statistics per season (wins, losses, batting avg, ERA, RPI)
- **`player_season_stats`** - Aggregated player statistics per season

#### Utility Tables
- **`schema_version`** - Track schema versions for migrations

#### Views
- **`v_active_teams`** - Active teams with conference information
- **`v_current_season_games`** - Games from the active season
- **`v_team_records`** - Team win-loss records by season

#### Triggers
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management for all core tables

### 2. Sample Data (`db/seed.sql`)

Pre-populated sample data for testing:
- **5 conferences** (SEC, ACC, Big 12, Pac-12, Big Ten)
- **10 teams** (Texas, LSU, Vanderbilt, Tennessee, Arkansas, Wake Forest, FSU, Duke, Oklahoma State, TCU)
- **8 players** (with realistic stats)
- **5 complete games** with box scores and player stats
- **Team season stats** and **player season stats**

### 3. Deployment Infrastructure

#### Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy-d1-schema.sh`)
Automated deployment script with:
- Database existence checking
- Schema application with verification
- Table counting and listing
- Optional seed data insertion
- Test query execution
- Colorized CLI output

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy-d1-schema.sh
./scripts/deploy-d1-schema.sh
```

#### Wrangler Configuration (`wrangler.toml`)
Updated with D1 database binding:
```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "blazesports-historical"
# database_id will be added after running: wrangler d1 create blazesports-historical
```

### 4. API Integration (`functions/api/college-baseball/stats-historical.js`)

Production-ready Worker function for querying historical data:

#### Endpoints
- **Team Stats:** `GET /api/college-baseball/stats-historical?team={teamId}&season={year}`
- **Player Stats:** `GET /api/college-baseball/stats-historical?player={playerId}`
- **Conference Standings:** `GET /api/college-baseball/stats-historical?conference={abbr}&season={year}`
- **Overview:** `GET /api/college-baseball/stats-historical?season={year}`

#### Features
- Graceful D1 availability checking
- Comprehensive error handling
- CORS support
- Caching headers (1 hour)
- Team season records
- Recent game history
- Career player statistics
- Conference standings with RPI
- Batting and pitching leaders

### 5. Data Ingestion Script (`scripts/ingest-historical-data.js`)

Node.js script for importing data from ESPN API:

**Features:**
- Fetch team data, schedules, and box scores from ESPN
- Generate parameterized SQL INSERT statements
- Built-in rate limiting (500ms between requests)
- Conflict resolution (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT)
- Console output for manual execution or piping to bash

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/ingest-historical-data.js --team 251 --season 2025
```

**Common Team IDs:**
- `251` - Texas Longhorns
- `238` - LSU Tigers
- `235` - Vanderbilt Commodores
- `2633` - Tennessee Volunteers

### 6. Documentation (`db/README.md`)

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Schema overview and table descriptions
- Setup instructions with wrangler commands

## Database Architecture

### Relationships

```
seasons (1) ──→ (M) games
             └──→ (M) team_season_stats
             └──→ (M) player_season_stats

conferences (1) ──→ (M) teams

teams (1) ──→ (M) games (home_team)
          └──→ (M) games (away_team)
          └──→ (M) team_rosters
          └──→ (M) team_season_stats

players (1) ──→ (M) team_rosters
            └──→ (M) batting_stats
            └──→ (M) pitching_stats
            └──→ (M) player_season_stats

games (1) ──→ (1) box_scores
          └──→ (M) batting_stats
          └──→ (M) pitching_stats
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **ESPN ID Mapping**: Each team, player, and game has an `espn_id` field for API integration
2. **Flexible Data Storage**: Uses TEXT for dates (ISO 8601) and JSON for complex data (inning-by-inning scores)
3. **Aggregate Tables**: Pre-computed season stats for performance
4. **Foreign Keys**: Maintain referential integrity across relationships
5. **Check Constraints**: Validate enum values and data ranges
6. **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns (team+season, player+season, date ranges)
7. **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp management

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create D1 Database

```bash
wrangler d1 create blazesports-historical
```

Copy the `database_id` from the output.

### Step 2: Update wrangler.toml

Edit `wrangler.toml` and add the database_id:
```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "blazesports-historical"
database_id = "your-database-id-here"  # ← Add this line
```

### Step 3: Run Deployment Script

```bash
./scripts/deploy-d1-schema.sh
```

This will:
1. Check if database exists
2. Apply the schema (creates all tables, views, triggers)
3. Verify table creation
4. Optionally insert seed data
5. Run test queries

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# List all tables
wrangler d1 execute blazesports-historical --remote --command="
  SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;
"

# Check data
wrangler d1 execute blazesports-historical --remote --command="
  SELECT COUNT(*) as teams FROM teams;
"
```

### Step 5: Test API Endpoint

Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
```bash
wrangler pages deploy . --project-name blazesportsintel
```

Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl "https://blazesportsintel.com/api/college-baseball/stats-historical?team=251&season=2025"
```

## Example Queries

### Get Team Season Record
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_team_records
WHERE team_name = 'Texas Longhorns'
  AND season = 2025;
```

### Get SEC Standings
```sql
SELECT
    t.name AS team,
    tss.wins,
    tss.losses,
    tss.conference_wins,
    tss.conference_losses,
    tss.rpi
FROM team_season_stats tss
JOIN teams t ON tss.team_id = t.team_id
JOIN conferences c ON t.conference_id = c.conference_id
JOIN seasons s ON tss.season_id = s.season_id
WHERE c.abbreviation = 'SEC'
  AND s.year = 2025
ORDER BY tss.conference_wins DESC;
```

### Get Player Career Stats
```sql
SELECT
    p.full_name,
    s.year AS season,
    pss.batting_average,
    pss.home_runs,
    pss.rbi
FROM player_season_stats pss
JOIN players p ON pss.player_id = p.player_id
JOIN seasons s ON pss.season_id = s.season_id
WHERE p.full_name = 'Ivan Melendez'
ORDER BY s.year DESC;
```

### Get Recent Games
```sql
SELECT
    g.game_date,
    ht.name AS home_team,
    g.home_score,
    at.name AS away_team,
    g.away_score
FROM games g
JOIN teams ht ON g.home_team_id = ht.team_id
JOIN teams at ON g.away_team_id = at.team_id
WHERE g.game_date >= date('now', '-7 days')
ORDER BY g.game_date DESC;
```

---

## Data Ingestion Pipeline

### Manual Ingestion (Current)

1. Run ingestion script:
```bash
node scripts/ingest-historical-data.js --team 251 --season 2025
```

2. Copy SQL commands from output

3. Execute manually or pipe to bash:
```bash
node scripts/ingest-historical-data.js --team 251 --season 2025 | grep "wrangler d1" | bash
```

### Automated Ingestion (Future)

Recommended architecture for production:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Cron Trigger   │ Daily at 3am CST
│  (Cloudflare)   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│  Worker         │ Fetch ESPN API
│  (ingest-data)  │ + Transform data
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│  D1 Database    │ Store historical
│  (blazesports)  │ records
└─────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create `functions/scheduled/ingest-daily.js` with cron trigger
2. Use `env.DB.batch()` for transactional inserts
3. Add error handling and retry logic
4. Log to Analytics Engine for monitoring

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes
All key query patterns are indexed:
- `teams.espn_id`, `teams.conference_id`
- `games.espn_id`, `games.season_id`, `games.game_date`
- `players.espn_id`, `players.position`
- `batting_stats.player_id`, `pitching_stats.player_id`
- `team_season_stats.team_id`, `team_season_stats.season_id`

### Caching Strategy
- **KV Cache**: 5 minutes for frequently accessed data
- **HTTP Cache-Control**: 1 hour for historical stats
- **Pre-aggregation**: Season stats computed and stored

### Query Optimization
- Use prepared statements with parameter binding
- Batch inserts for bulk data ingestion
- Leverage views for complex joins
- Monitor query performance with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`

---

## Maintenance

### Backups
```bash
# Export database
wrangler d1 export blazesports-historical > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Restore from backup
wrangler d1 execute blazesports-historical --file=backup-20251016.sql
```

### Schema Migrations
Future schema changes should:
1. Create new migration file: `db/migrations/002_add_feature.sql`
2. Update `schema_version` table
3. Test on local copy before production
4. Apply with version tracking

### Monitoring
- Track query execution times
- Monitor database size growth
- Set up alerts for failed ingestions
- Use Analytics Engine for usage metrics
